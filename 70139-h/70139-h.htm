<p>Rosamond Arleigh read the telegram over and over—once,
twice, thrice, and her face grew pale as death, while
into her dark eyes there crept a look of desperation. She
glanced across the crowd of happy faces before her—the
merry, care-free throng that filled her brilliant drawing-rooms
to overflowing, and her pale face was convulsed
with pain, and she set her white teeth into her red under
lip until the blood started.</p>

<p>“I had nearly forgotten!” she muttered. “Heaven
help me, I had almost allowed myself to forget! The time
will soon be up—the hour will soon be here when he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
come to extort a bitter penalty for that mad mistake of
the past. I am brought to bay at last; there is no escape!
May Heaven show me mercy, for I need expect none from
man!”</p>

<p>She stood there, pale and queenly, her head, its dark
locks just touched with silver, resting against the door-casing,
as she watched the gleaming kaleidoscope of dancers
floating dreamily away to the sweet, sensuous waltz-music.
Her dark eyes rested long and lovingly upon a
sweet face among the dancers—a fair face lighted up by
great dark eyes, the small head crowned by a mass of
waving golden hair; a girlish, graceful figure in white silk
trimmed with fern leaves. Some subtile instinct made the
beautiful eyes of the girl turn in the direction of that
watching figure with a swift start of pleasure, and a look
of fond affection passed between the two.</p>

<p>Stifling a sigh, Rosamond Arleigh turned away and
went out upon the broad gallery which ran in front of
the rambling old house—a real Southern country home.
Once there, she sunk wearily into a low lounging chair.
There was the sound of light footsteps, the soft <i>frou-frou</i>
of silken skirts; then a tiny white-gloved hand came down
lightly upon Mrs. Arleigh’s shoulder and rested there like
a snow-flake, while a gay, girlish voice cried, lightly:</p>

<p>“Mamma! You dear little humbug! you said you
would not be able to come down-stairs to-night, and, lo!
here you are. All my pleasure has been spoiled until
now; the sight of you cheers me once more! Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Constance is doing her level best to make my ball a
success; but dear as she is, auntie isn’t <i>you</i>! And I——”</p>

<p>“You are enjoying yourself, Violet?” her mother
asked, in an anxious tone. “You are satisfied? Do you
like your ball?”</p>

<p>“Like it? Mamma, it is divine! There never was
another such ball—never in the whole world, I am sure!
I ought to be very happy to-night, mamma; I have so
much to be thankful for. My beautiful home, and you,
and—and all those who are so good to me. And it is my
eighteenth birthday, and this is my very first ball!”</p>

<p>She has summed it all up in those last words. In
all the years to come there will never be anything like
this in her life—never again. She may be surfeited
with pleasures, may revel in wealth, and (natural sequence)
count her friends by the score; but never again
will she taste of the pure, unalloyed delight, the innocent
rapture of her first ball—her eighteenth birthday.</p>

<p>Rosamond Arleigh listens to her only child, and as she
listens her face grows pale to ghastliness—some hidden
anguish seems tearing at her heart-strings—but she tries
to smile, and drawing the golden head down, kisses the
girl’s red lips.</p>

<p>“My little Violet,” she says, softly, all the beautiful
mother-love shining in her eyes, “enjoy yourself while
you are young, ‘gather the roses while you may;’ for,
oh, my darling, the dark days are coming!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Her white hand still clutches that crumpled telegram,
and the look of horror deepens in her eyes.</p>

<p>Violet uttered a low cry.</p>

<p>“<i>Mamma!</i> you are ill again! I was afraid when I
saw you in the door-way that you were exerting yourself
too much, and you still feeble from your late illness. Go
up to your room again, will you, dear? Come, let me
go with you.”</p>

<p>She put her white arm about her mother’s waist in a
pretty, protecting way, and laid her satiny cheek against
the pale one with a caressing little gesture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arleigh forced a smile.</p>

<p>“I am better now. Forgive me, daughter. I had no
right to mar your happiness with my melancholy. Go
back to the ball-room and dance; I see Mr. Yorke looking
for you.”</p>

<p>A swift wave of crimson suffuses the girl’s delicate
cheeks, and the big, dark eyes droop shyly; but a sweet
smile curves her dainty lips, and the white arms tighten
their grasp about her mother’s form.</p>

<p>“Leonard Yorke?” carelessly. “Oh, yes; I see him
now. Mamma, you <i>like</i> Leonard, do you not?”</p>

<p>“To be sure; there isn’t a better young man in all
Louisiana. But, Violet”—a sudden terror flashing into
her eyes and her voice trembling audibly—“surely you
do not mean—there is nothing between Leonard and you,
is there, my darling?”</p>

<p>She shook her golden head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“No-o; of course not, <i>ma mère</i>—not exactly. Only—I
like him. There, ‘I done tole you!’ as the darkies say.”</p>

<p>A spasm of pain convulsed Rosamond Arleigh’s fair
face for a moment and her form trembled perceptibly.</p>

<p>Violet started in alarm.</p>

<p>“What a selfish thing I am!” she exclaimed. “Here
I am keeping you here when you ought to go to your
own room and lie down. Come, dear; I can not return
to my guests and know that you are out here alone and
ill. And there is Leonard coming now; he is looking for
me. Will you not let me go upstairs with you, mamma?”</p>

<p>More to satisfy Violet than for any other reason, Rosamond
Arleigh arose to her feet and allowed her daughter
to lead her into the hall, which runs through the center
of the house, and up the broad staircase, half hidden
in flowers.</p>

<p>The band was playing sweetly, sadly, by way of interlude,
“<i>Ah, che le morte!</i>”</p>

<p>Rosamond Arleigh’s eyes grew misty.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Ah, I have sighed to rest me deep in the quiet grave!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But all in vain I crave——’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She stopped abruptly. She had spoken the words half
aloud, and Violet had heard them.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” her sweet voice full of wistfulness, “are
not you happy?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i>—happy?”</p>

<p>She has reached the door of her own room now, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
opening it, passes within, followed closely by her daughter.</p>

<p>“Happy? Why, of course—of course I am happy!
Ha! ha! Why not? Why should I be anything else but
happy and—and gay? Now, go down-stairs, dear, back
to your guests and the dance. And don’t forget, Violet,
that you are only eighteen, and this is your first ball!”</p>

<p>The girl obeys unwillingly, for there is something
strange in her mother’s face, and the dark eyes glitter
wildly.</p>

<p>“Kiss me, mamma,” she pleads, throwing her white
arms about her mother’s neck. “I shall be <i>awfully</i> uneasy
about you all the time, and I will come back to you
as soon as I can, and——”</p>

<p>“No, dear; don’t do that. I am going to retire now
and rest. The music does not disturb me. I—I rather
like to hear it. Kiss me again, Violet. Good-night, my
baby. May God and the holy angels have you ever in
their keeping! Good-bye—good-bye!”</p>

<p>And long afterward it struck home to Violet Arleigh’s
heart, with all the force and intensity of a blow, how,
instead of good-night, she had said <i>good-bye</i>!</p>

<p>Violet left the room reluctantly, and went down-stairs—went
to join the handsome, dark-eyed young man upon
the broad gallery overhung with trailing rose-vines, awaiting
her impatiently. A moment more, and he had her
in his arms, her golden head resting upon his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Violet—<i>my</i> Violet! You are mine, are you not?”
he whispered, passionately.</p>

<p>She smiled up into his face, her dark eyes full of a tender
light.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that it is true Leonard,” she returned, demurely.</p>

<p>“Then you <i>do</i> love me?” he cried, rapturously, drawing
her closer to his heart.</p>

<p>The shy eyes drooped.</p>

<p>“Yes; I love you,” she whispered, softly. “I think I
have always done that, Leonard, ever since—ever since I
knew you.”</p>

<p>“And I may speak to your mother to-morrow, darling?”
he persisted. “I can not wait any longer. I want
you, Violet; and my home is waiting for a mistress—a
queen to reign over it. And my mother will be glad, I
am sure.”</p>

<p>Violet shook her head dubiously.</p>

<p>He was the only son of his mother, and she was a
widow—a very dignified and arbitrary woman, with a
pride second to none—an overbearing, tyrannical pride
which ruled and dominated all her life.</p>

<p>Would she welcome to her home the girl who would
henceforth usurp her place in that home, as she had already
in the heart of her son?</p>

<p>Violet turned away with a strange, cold feeling settling
down over her heart.</p>

<p>“I am not so certain of that,” she returned; “but we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
will not trouble ourselves about it now, Leonard. Of
course you know that even if mamma says yes—do you
think she <i>will</i>, Leonard?—I could not <i>think</i> of such a
thing as marrying—oh, not for ages!”</p>

<p>A look of amusement passed over his face; he bit his
lip to suppress a smile.</p>

<p>“Nice prospect for <i>me</i>!” he cried, ruefully. “Now,
sweetheart, let <i>me</i> lay down the law. I shall seek an interview
with your mother in the morning—my poor
darling, we are both alike fatherless—if she is able to
receive me. I am so grieved that her health is not good;
but I will try not to excite her; and if she will consent to
give her treasure into my keeping, I propose that our marriage
take place—let me see! this is April—<i>May</i> is an
unlucky month for weddings. What do you say to the
first of June, sweetheart?”</p>

<p>“June!”—with a frightened start—“oh, Leonard, <i>impossible</i>!”</p>

<p>“Nothing is impossible, my darling,” he returned,
coolly. “And now, Violet, the music has struck up the
‘Manola.’ Come, let us waltz together once more. It will
be your first dance in the capacity of my betrothed wife!”</p>

<p>She laid her small gloved hand upon his black coat-sleeve,
and they returned to the ball-room, where they
were soon floating away to the sweet waltz-music.</p>

<p>And over their young, defenseless heads a cloud was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
gathering, creeping nearer and nearer. Soon it would
envelop them in its inky folds.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Upstairs in her pretty sitting-room Rosamond Arleigh
was pacing slowly up and down, her head bent, her
hands clasped tightly together, her face set and pale as
death.</p>

<p>“There is no way of escape,” she muttered, hoarsely,
coming to a halt at length in her monotonous pacing to
and fro. “I am like the doomed wretch in the Italian
prison, who felt its walls closing in around him a little
nearer, a little nearer every day. I shall soon be crushed
within the walls of destiny and a relentless hatred—a
hatred which has existed for years—a hatred which calls
itself love, and which will never be satisfied until it has
wrought my ruin, body and soul! And there is no escape,
no way out—save death!”</p>

<p>Her eyes wandered restlessly over to a small cabinet
which occupied a corner of the room. There were a half-dozen
vials standing upon the upper shelf. One of them
bore a grinning skull and crossbones, and was labeled
“Chloral—Poison.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she went on, thoughtfully, “how he intends
to begin—how and when he will strike—to deal the
fatal blow which will devastate my life and doom my
child—my beautiful girl—to endless misery and shame.
<i>He</i> says he will be here to-morrow at midnight—to-morrow!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Ha-a!” turning the crumpled telegram over in her
shaking hand. “Why, the message has been delayed. A
common occurrence in these country towns. They have
neglected to send it to me here at The Oaks. Yet—yet
I have thus gained a few hours’ respite. Let me see.
The message is dated yesterday,” she went on, carefully
examining it once more. “Good heavens! he will be here
this very night! May Heaven have mercy, and help me
to be brave!”</p>

<p>One! chimed from the little gilded clock upon the marble
mantel of the pretty room—two! three! Rosamond
Arleigh clasped her hands, and her eyes were riveted upon
the time-piece. Four! five, six! Her breath came thick
and fast; her form trembled like an aspen. Seven! eight!
nine! ten! eleven! <i>Twelve!</i></p>

<p>Before the last stroke had fairly died away into silence
there was a faint rap at the door of the room. A moment’s
pause, during which her white lips moved as
though in prayer, and then, pale as a statue, Rosamond
Arleigh made her way unsteadily over to the door and
threw it open.</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A BITTER RECKONING.</div>


<p>There was a brief pause, a silence during which you
could hear distinctly the great strangling heart-throbs of
the woman who stood staring blankly into the face of her
unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p>Below-stairs the revelry went on; the patter of light
feet upon the polished floor of the ball-room; the gay
peals of merry laughter; and over all the wailing notes
of the music, with its tender, pleading, and wordless entreaty,
as the band played “Love’s Young Dream.”</p>

<p>Rosamond Arleigh started, and one white hand went
to her heart, pressing against it with a passionate gesture.
She bowed coldly.</p>

<p>“So it is you, Mr. Warrington?” with affected indifference.
“Come in.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is I. Whom else should it be?” retorted the
intruder, and a tall, dark figure crossed the threshold,
closed the door and locked it carefully. “I am exceedingly
punctual,” he went on, coolly, as he sunk
uninvited into a seat. “It is a rule of mine never to
keep any one, and more especially a lady, waiting. Why,
Rosamond, my dear, you look ‘all broke up.’ What is the
matter with you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Rosamond Arleigh frowned.</p>

<p>“I have been ill, that is all,” she returned, coldly;
“only a little touch of the old heart trouble. You have
called here to-night, Gilbert Warrington, to—It is the
old business, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“You are right; it is the old affair, that little slip of
yours which is fated to follow you through life like a
dark shadow, fated to dog your footsteps to the very
grave. ‘The sins of the parents’—you know the rest
of it, my dear Rosamond. So your sin will fall, in all its
black horror and shame and disgrace, <i>upon your child</i>!”</p>

<p>Rosamond Arleigh covered her white face with her
cold, trembling hands, and her graceful figure swayed
unsteadily.</p>

<p>“You would not!” she faltered, brokenly.</p>

<p>“Would I not? See here, Rosamond.”</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington rose and stood before her, a man
of some five-and-forty years, tall and commanding, with
keen gray eyes, and a face as colorless as marble; a heavy
black mustache and chin-beard; thin, cruel lips; a restless
glitter in the shifting eyes. Not a face to trust.</p>

<p>“You understand me, Rosamond?” he went on, in a
low, hissing tone, transfixing his terrified listener with
his beady eyes. “I wish to settle this matter absolutely.
You will have to marry me or see your child eternally
disgraced through the bad black blot upon her
name which your own mad deed in the dead and gone past
has affixed there. Ah, you need not wince; I mean to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
plain words. I do not intend to handle you with gloves
just because <i>you</i> are a purse-proud aristocrat, while <i>I</i>
come from the slums. I intend that you shall feel the full
sting of the power that I hold over you. <i>You</i>, Rosamond
Arleigh, sole representative of an old aristocratic family,
one of the best in the land, you whose name is good for
many thousands, who move in the most exclusive circle
among the rich and great, you are something from which
the proud and haughty dames of your select circle would
shrink if the truth were known. The veriest wretch in
all the land would not take your hand to-night if the truth
concerning your past were made public, Rosamond Arleigh.”</p>

<p>“Have—mercy!” she falters, brokenly. “Be human,
Gilbert Warrington; show me some pity, some consideration.
For the sake of the past, in memory of the dead
and gone days when I took you by the hand and led you
up to prosperity, have pity, have some gratitude——”</p>

<p>“<i>Gratitude?</i> Bah! Talk of something tangible, something
that exists, something that I can understand. Gratitude?
Ha! ha! You make me tired. No, no, my
friend; we will confine ourselves to facts and drop all that
high-flown rhapsody.”</p>

<p>She lifted her white face for a moment, and her eyes
rested upon his with a look of imploring entreaty.</p>

<p>“Is there no alternative?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“None. You must marry me, you must become my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
wife at once, or the whole world shall ring with the truth—that
you were only Hubert Arleigh’s——”</p>

<p>“Stop! For the love of God, do not speak that word.
It is false—false—false!”</p>

<p>“<i>Prove it!</i>”</p>

<p>“Alas! I can not, as you know too well. Gilbert Warrington,
I offer you all I possess in the world—all my
wealth—<i>everything</i>—if you will give me those papers in
your possession and let me go free, let me take my child
and go away from here, so far that none here will ever
learn my whereabouts. Is that not enough to buy your
silence?”</p>

<p>“No! a thousand times no! There is not money enough
in all Louisiana to purchase my silence. Rosamond Arleigh,
<i>I love you</i>, and I mean to make you my wife.
I have loved you for years, I have held this secret suspended
over your head for years, but now—now—you
shall marry me, or the secret shall be made public, and
you and yours ruined forever! You will be shunned as a
pestilence, and Violet, think of what her fate will be!”</p>

<p>A low groan issued from the woman’s pallid lips, then
all was still. The silence grew oppressive.</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington drew near the bowed figure and
touched her lightly upon the arm.</p>

<p>“‘Every man has his price,’ it is said,” he says, slowly.
“You know mine. There is no alternative. You will
consent, Rosamond?”</p>

<p>No answer. The bowed head is lifted, the wild eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
are staring straight before them into space, the cold hands
twitch convulsively, the white lips quiver; but not a word
escapes her, not a moan.</p>

<p>“You have heard my proposition,” the smooth voice
goes on, lowly; “you must say ‘<i>Yes</i>’ at once, or I shall
go down-stairs now and expose your secret to the select
society gathered here to do honor to your daughter’s
eighteenth birthday. You were scarcely eighteen when
this occurred of which you are guilty; but Violet will not
think of that—will show you no pity because you were
so young when it happened—and she, your own child,
will look upon her mother—the mother so dearly, so idolatrously
loved—with scorn, contempt, loathing. Will you
consent, Rosamond?”</p>

<p>“No! no! no! A thousand times no!” she panted, defiantly.
“I would sooner take my own life! Better to
commit suicide than to fall into <i>your</i> hands, you human
tiger! Oh, Heaven! that I should be compelled to listen
to such insults beneath my own roof, and be powerless to
avenge them!”</p>

<p>She fell back into a seat; pale and gasping for breath,
great drops of perspiration standing upon her brow—the
cold dew of agony—her features convulsed with suffering,
one hand clutching—clutching at her heart, which
was throbbing as though trying to break through its
mortal prison. Her dark eyes, bloodshot with suffering,
wandered slowly over to the cabinet in the corner, where
stood the vial marked “Chloral.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>A fiendish expression crept over Gilbert Warrington’s
face. With a furtive glance around, as though fearing
lest some human eye was upon his movements, he flew
to the cabinet, and snatching the bottle from the shelf,
thrust it into Rosamond Arleigh’s shaking hand.</p>

<p>At that moment the awful silence was broken by the
sound of light footsteps flying up the stairs. They paused
at the door of the room, and a timid rap sounded upon
the panel.</p>

<p>“Mamma!” called Violet, softly. “Are you ill, dear?
May I not come in? It is I, your little Violet. I thought
I heard you call me. Open the door and let me in.”</p>

<p>There was no answer. Rosamond Arleigh could not
speak. Twice she opened her lips to utter Violet’s name,
to answer her loving inquiries, but no sound came forth.
Trembling, panting in mortal agony, she crouched there,
her eyes upon Gilbert Warrington’s cold face.</p>

<p>Still as a statue, Warrington waited for Violet to go.
She must not suspect his presence there; neither she nor
any one else in the house must know of the midnight
visitor who had entered in the midst of the revelry.
He would wait there until Violet, believing that her
mother was asleep and did not hear her, would go away.</p>

<p>At last the sweet voice ceased to plead for admission,
and slowly and reluctantly the girl retraced her steps to
the ball-room. Once there, she sought her aunt, Mrs.
Rutledge, her mother’s widowed sister, who made her
home at The Oaks, together with her daughter Hilda.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Mrs. Rutledge was a tall, stylish woman, attired in black
lace, with a delicate, high-bred face and large, dark eyes,
like Rosamond Arleigh’s own.</p>

<p>“Aunt Constance”—Violet’s voice was full of uneasiness—“I
am so anxious about mamma. I was
dancing the Lancers just now, and all at once I thought
I heard her call me. It troubled me so that I induced
Miss Ray to take my place, made it all right with my
partner, and hurried up to mamma’s room. But though I
rapped hard at the door, I received no answer, and the
room was so still—as still as the grave! Aunt Constance,
do you think there is anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“Wrong? No. You alarm yourself unnecessarily,
my child. If Rosamond wanted anything, she would
ring. She is probably sleeping soundly. Go now and
enjoy your ball, my child; you will never have another
like it.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>The sweet voice was full of sadness, and held a ring of
unconscious prophecy.</p>

<p>As she turned dejectedly away, a graceful figure in
floating white lace and pink rose-buds glided swiftly to
her side—a girl of some twenty years, a beautiful, dark-eyed
girl. It was Hilda Rutledge.</p>

<p>“Where is Leonard—Mr. Yorke, I should say?” she
began at once. “I promised to go down to the river with
him to show him the new boat. A <i>tête-à-tête</i> stroll in the
moonlight! Violet,” with a light, rippling laugh, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
a swift glance into the girl’s pale face, “Look out.
Leonard Yorke is fickle and likes to flirt. He has been
saying no end of sweet things to me to-night.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it!”</p>

<p>Violet’s beautiful eyes flashed with indignant protest.
Hilda laughed.</p>

<p>“What sublime trust, to be sure!” she exclaimed.
“Violet, you will learn the world better when you have
seen more of it. My dear cousin, whatever you do, never
trust in a man; they are all false and fickle.”</p>

<p>“Leonard is not.”</p>

<p>“Ah! so you acknowledge that you are in love with
Mr. Yorke? Really, Violet, I am surprised, for he has
not been in earnest with you, and I have reason to believe
that he cares a great deal for me.”</p>

<p>“It is false!” panted Violet, indignantly. “Hilda, I
did not think that you could be so cruel to me. Let me
pass!”</p>

<p>She fled past the white-robed figure like some wild
creature.</p>

<p>Hilda’s dusky eyes followed the flying figure, and a
curious brassy light crept into their depths. Glancing
up, she saw Leonard Yorke coming swiftly in her direction.
A look of passionate love flashed into her eyes,
and under her breath she muttered, harshly:</p>

<p>“He is looking for her, but he shall not find her. He
shall come with me. I <i>will</i> have him for a little while
alone to-night, and I will manage to find out if he cares<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
a little for me. He has always been so kind and gentle;
he has been with me almost as much as he has with <i>her</i>;
and I don’t see why he can not love me the best. He <i>shall</i>
love me! I swear it! Oh, Leonard! Leonard! for your
dear sake I would lay my life down! I would barter all
my hopes of happiness!”</p>

<p>Leonard Yorke came swiftly to her side. At sight of
Hilda standing there alone, he stopped short.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Hilda, I thought that Miss Arleigh was
here,” he exclaimed. “I am sure I saw her speaking
with you a few moments ago.”</p>

<p>“To be sure; but she is gone now—gone to walk in
the moonlight with Captain Venners. Let us go and find
them.”</p>

<p>Captain Venners! If there was a man in the world
whom Leonard Yorke detested, it was Will Venners—handsome,
dashing Will Venners—an outrageous flirt,
and a general favorite with the ladies. And Leonard did
not dream that the tale was only a fabrication of Hilda
to arouse his jealousy, with a secret hope that, in his pride
and pique, he would turn to <i>her</i>. And so he did. Where
is the man who would not have done so? She was very
beautiful and fascinating, and—Violet had gone to walk
in the moonlight with Venners. Leonard’s heart was
very sore.</p>

<p>He offered Hilda his arm, and they left the house and
wandered down to the river-side—the beautiful silvery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
river which wound in and out between its green banks
and shone in the moonlight like molten silver.</p>

<p>“I can not imagine what’s the matter with Violet,”
Hilda began, pathetically, lifting her great dark eyes to
Leonard’s thoughtful face. “She seems actually absorbed
in Captain Venners, and—and I’m afraid that he
is only flirting with her. You know what a dreadful flirt
he is. One glance from Will Venners’ dark eyes, and a
poor woman’s heart is subjugated—slain. And to think
that, although he quotes poetry, and writes it, too—such
beautiful poetry—that he is only amusing himself! Yet,
no; I really think that Will believes it all himself. He
means all that he says in every flirtation in which he indulges.
But as soon as affairs begin to assume a serious
aspect, like the knight in the old song,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘He loves—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And rides away.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But poor, dear Violet seems quite infatuated.”</p>

<p>“Stop!” Leonard Yorke’s voice was hoarse and
strained. “Miss Hilda, stop, I beg of you. Don’t you
know—you surely <i>must</i> know—that she and I are——”</p>

<p>“Good friends? I know it. Dear me, Leon—Mr.
Yorke—of course, everybody knows that; and I was
about to suggest that you remonstrate with Violet in regard
to her infatuation. Yet, truly, their conduct lately
makes me suspect that they are engaged. Ah! there they
are now. Don’t they look like a pair of betrothed
lovers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>It is said that the devil always helps his own; and without
any personal allusions in regard to Miss Hilda Rutledge,
it certainly seemed as though his Satanic Majesty
had intervened to assist her cruel scheme, for whom
should they come upon, standing in the silvery moonlight
under the branches of a live-oak not far away, but Violet
Arleigh, and at her side handsome Will Venners! He was
gazing down into her face with a tender look in those
dangerous dark eyes. It looked for all the world like
a leaf from a love story. But in reality this is what he
was saying to her:</p>

<p>“So, Miss Violet, you think that there is hope for me?
I have loved her so long; it is no flirtation this time.
Sweet Jessie Glyndon is the only woman I have ever
loved well enough to wish to make my wife.”</p>

<p>And Violet’s sympathetic tone responds:</p>

<p>“I think she likes you, Will. Shall I tell you why?
Because, although she laughs at you when you attempt to
enact the lover, just let any one venture a slighting remark
concerning you, and she will fly into a passion and
defend you with all her might. Jessie Glyndon is a
peculiar woman—the very proudest woman I ever knew.
But a woman doesn’t hate a man whom she watches with
her very soul in her eyes. An hour ago, Will, I found
her in the rose arbor all alone. She was watching you
in the distance—you were flirting awfully with some one,
you naughty boy!—and I heard her say, believing herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
all alone, ‘Dear Will—dear old Dark Eyes! He will
never know—never know!’”</p>

<p>“Did she?”</p>

<p>Will Venners’ hand closes eagerly down upon Violet’s
small gloved hand, and Leonard Yorke’s jealous eyes observe
the action.</p>

<p>“Did she really, Miss Violet? And yet she was so cold
to me. Miss Violet, will you give her this? It is a little
poem I wrote for her.”</p>

<p>“With pleasure.”</p>

<p>A folded sheet of paper fluttered from Will Venners’
hand into Violet’s grasp; she hid it in the lace of her
corsage.</p>

<p>“I will give it to Jessie to-night if possible,” Violet
says, softly; “and now you had better take me back to
the house; I must go and see mamma for a moment; I am
afraid she is ill.”</p>

<p>As the words pass her lips she lifts her eyes and they
rest upon two figures strolling leisurely on in the moonlight—Leonard
Yorke, her lover, and at his side Hilda
Rutledge. Something in their attitude makes a cold chill
creep over Violet’s heart; she turns away and hastens to
the house.</p>

<p>In the entrance hall she pauses and glances eagerly
about her in search of Jessie Glyndon. She sees her at
last, a brown-haired young woman with blue-gray eyes
and an air of quiet dignity which some people considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
out of place, for she was only a dependent, the hired companion
to Leonard Yorke’s mother, and had lived at
Yorke Towers for a year.</p>

<p>Wishing to deliver Will’s poem at once—for she felt
certain that this was more than a mere flirtation—Violet
hastened in pursuit of Miss Glyndon. On—on to the conservatory
Violet made her way, and at last, just beside the
fountain, whose silvery spray fell into a marble basin full
of water-lilies, Violet found herself face to face with—Leonard
Yorke. Hilda had disappeared. He came
swiftly to her side, his face was pale, but he was determined
not to betray his emotions.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Violet?” he asked, gently. “You
look troubled. Tell me what it is that is making you unhappy?”</p>

<p>Her great dark eyes were lifted to his face. She forgot
everything but that she loved him.</p>

<p>“I am never unhappy when I am with you, Leonard,”
she returned, simply; “but I will confess that I am
troubled about mamma. I never felt so strangely in my
life. Wherever I go I am haunted by the sight of her pale
face. Oh, Leonard, if anything should happen to her it
would kill me! She is so——”</p>

<p>She stopped short, and the words died away into silence
upon her quivering lips.</p>

<p><i>What was that?</i></p>

<p>A shriek, an awful shriek, had resounded throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the house—a wild, heart-rending cry of agony. Violet’s
face grew ashen white.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” she moaned. “Oh, Leonard,
Leonard, something awful has happened! <i>What is it?</i>”</p>

<p>He turned to the door, then slipped back to Violet’s side
and took her in his arms. For the moment all jealous
doubts were set at rest—for the moment only—it is hard
to kill jealousy.</p>

<p>“Be brave and calm, my darling,” he whispered, gently;
“I will stand between you and all harm!”</p>

<p>But, alas! there comes a time into all lives when human
love is powerless and human care can avail nothing. Such
an hour had come to Violet Arleigh now.</p>

<p>“Wait here a moment,” the young man went on,
eagerly, pityingly, all jealous distrust swallowed up in
anxiety. “I will go and see.”</p>

<p>He left the conservatory hastily; but though he did not
know it, Violet followed close behind him. It is so hard to
be told that you must sit still, and wait in silent inaction,
while others make all the effort, do all that we so long to
do for our loved ones in extremity. And some unerring
instinct warned Violet Arleigh that whatever had come
upon her now, to darken her life forever, it was connected
with her mother.</p>

<p>As she left the conservatory she chanced to glance in
the direction of a glass door which opened into the
grounds, and her quick eyes caught a glimpse of a vanishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
figure, which disappeared in the shrubbery and was
lost to sight—the tall, dark form of a man. It was Gilbert
Warrington.</p>

<div class="chaptitle">THE TRAGEDY.</div>


<p>Violet hastened back to the drawing-room to be met
by anxious friends with pale, frightened faces.</p>

<p>Some one tried to intercept her, but Violet’s eyes were
riveted upon one figure—Mrs. Rutledge.</p>

<p>That lady had fallen helplessly upon a sofa, and was
weeping hysterically, wringing her white hands in uncontrollable
grief. The shriek which had resounded through
the house, terrifying the guests, had issued from her lips.
It was she who had first discovered the dread thing that
had occurred.</p>

<p>Secretly troubled by Violet’s anxiety over her mother,
Mrs. Rutledge had stolen up to Mrs. Arleigh’s room, only
to come flying down again, her face like the face of a dead
woman, and shrieks of horror issuing from her pale lips.
She had found the door of the room unlocked, and turning
the knob, her eyes fell upon a ghastly sight.</p>

<p>Seated near the table in an easy-chair was her sister,
Rosamond Arleigh—<i>stone dead</i>! One cold hand had
grasped a crumpled piece of paper; on the table close by
an <i>empty</i> vial labeled “<i>Chloral—Poison</i>.”</p>

<p>Had she died by her own hand?</p>

<p>How Violet found out all the particulars of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
ghastly story, she never knew. The first thing of which
she was conscious, she was kneeling at her mother’s
side, her arms about the cold, dead form, kissing the
rigid lips, and begging her over and over again to speak
or give some sign that she still lived. In all the impotence
of her awful grief the child knelt there, weeping,
moaning.</p>

<p><i>Dead!</i> Could it be possible? Her mother, who had
been more like an elder sister to her than a parent—her
beautiful, sad-faced mother, who had been to the girl the
light of her eyes, the very soul of her!</p>

<p>Some one unwound the clinging arms from about the
cold form at last, and Leonard Yorke led Violet away,
to make room for the physician and coroner, who had
arrived together.</p>

<p>Just as Leonard led the girl from the chamber of death
the little gilded clock on the mantel chimed forth the
hour—<i>two</i>!</p>

<p>Such a short—such a very short time since she had
been the happiest, most care-free of creatures, and now
all her happiness was over, all the foam gone from the
beaker of life! To her the whole world was altered.</p>

<p>Leonard led the orphan girl into the library, and closing
the door, left her alone; and there Mrs. Rutledge
found her, crouching in the depths of an easy-chair, her
wan little face drooping like a fading lily. Mrs. Rutledge
slipped into the girl’s cold hand a piece of crumpled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
paper. It was the same that had been found between
the stiffened fingers of the dead woman.</p>

<p>“You had better try to read it, my dear,” she said,
softly. “It seems to be a paper of importance. The
inquest is over, and the coroner is puzzled. <i>There is
no trace of poison in the body.</i> It is all a mystery——”</p>

<p>She checked herself abruptly, for Violet had opened the
crumpled paper, and was reading what was written there—reading
it with eyes dilated and dark with awful horror,
a slow change creeping over her girlish face, a
change that was fearful to see. Her features seemed to
freeze down into a stone mask, and an icy look of despair
settled slowly over her face. With a low moan, she
crumpled the letter in her hand and staggered to her
feet. She did not swoon away, or moan, or cry out,
after the fashion of ordinary women. To her, as with
many natures that suffer most intensely, the boon of
unconsciousness was denied.</p>

<p>Trembling like a leaf, she stood with that fatal letter
clutched in one shaking hand, her dark eyes staring
straight before her, fixed and wild.</p>

<p>The library door opened softly, and a man crossed the
threshold. Her eyes fell upon his face, and she started
with a low cry of horror and hatred, a cry which ended
in a broken moan of despair.</p>

<p>It was Gilbert Warrington.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">DRIVEN TO THE WALL.</div>


<p>Her eyes rested upon his face with a wild stare of terror,
which grew deeper and more intense as he crossed
the threshold and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Tall, dark, saturnine, he was not a pleasant person to
look at as he came to a halt upon the rug before the fireless
grate and stood staring into her frightened face with
eyes full of cold scrutiny.</p>

<p>For years she had been accustomed to see this man at
long intervals, when he would suddenly and unexpectedly
intrude upon her mother with some mysterious errand.
There would be a private interview, and then he would
disappear, leaving behind him a gloomy shadow—her
mother’s face sad and sorrowful, her manner constrained,
and the evidence of intense mental suffering.</p>

<p>As he stood before the girl now, she mentally decided
that he was destined to be the evil genius of her life.
And she was right.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss Violet Arleigh,” he began at last, breaking
the silence which rested upon the room, “you have read
your mother’s letter, I see. What do you think of its
contents—the communication made therein?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Silence! The girl’s dark eyes blazed with wordless indignation.</p>

<p>“What do I think, Mr. Gilbert Warrington?” she made
answer, her voice trembling with scorn and contempt. “I
think what I have always thought—that you are the
greatest villain unhung!”</p>

<p>He winced perceptibly, and a faint tinge of color suffused
his sallow cheek for a moment, then receded,
leaving his face pale and resolute as before.</p>

<p>“Miss Arleigh is disposed to be complimentary,” he
sneered, a baleful light kindling in his deep-set eyes.
“You would do well to choose your words.”</p>

<p>“What is your business here?” she demanded, abruptly,
after a brief pause, during which she studied the
face of the man before her, with utter scorn in her eyes.
“What has brought <i>you</i> here so unexpectedly? And
answer me this, Gilbert Warrington: <i>how did you know
the contents of the letter which I have just read?</i>”</p>

<p>He starts, and his lips close down upon a stifled imprecation.
He has made a false move; let slip something
which he should have guarded with his very life. His
eyes seek the floor for a moment, then are once more
uplifted.</p>

<p>“It is no concern of yours how I became acquainted
with the contents of that letter,” he said, slowly. “Let it
suffice that I <i>do</i> know. And I ask you, Miss Violet Arleigh,
what are you going to do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>She smoothed out the crumpled sheet of paper in her
hand, and glanced over its contents once more.</p>

<p>“My mother states that you have a claim upon her—<i>you</i>!”—the
girl’s sweet voice rang out in clear, scornful
tones—“and she directs me to carry out your instructions.
Mr. Gilbert Warrington, I do not believe that this
was really my mother’s wish. She has been influenced,
overpowered, coerced in this matter, or”—the great dark
eyes transfix the glittering orbs of the man as she goes
on slowly—“or the letter is a forgery, and Rosamond
Arleigh never wrote a word of it. <i>You know best!</i>”</p>

<p>With an angry cry like the stifled howl of a wild beast,
Gilbert Warrington sprung forward and grasped the girl’s
arm in a fierce grip. His face was absolutely colorless, his
eyes blazed.</p>

<p>“You devil!” he hissed, bending his head until his eyes
seemed to burn into her very soul, “you shall obey me,
do just as I direct, or you will live to regret it. I have
come here at this hour—this sad hour—when the discovery
of your mother’s death has just been made, simply
and solely to confer with you before the lawyers get hold
of the business here, and the authorities have time to put
in their oar. So I slipped in here when I found that you
were alone, and my object is this: Whatever may be the
terms and conditions of your mother’s will, you will have
to submit—whether you are pleased or not—and be silent
as the grave, too. Now that you have read your mother’s
letter, you have some idea of the burden that she bore in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
secret—the burden of her own sin. I loved your mother,
Violet Arleigh!”</p>

<p>“<i>You?</i>”</p>

<p>The tone, the glance, the utter, stinging contempt, were
enough to drive a man wild. He flushed angrily, and
ground out an oath between his close-shut teeth. But he
controlled himself.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he snarled; “you are having your day
now, <i>my</i> time will come before long. Scratch, bite, tear
about your cage, my little tigress, your claws will be cut
soon, and you will find yourself utterly powerless!”</p>

<p>“Leave me!” she commanded, her voice trembling with
indignation. “How dare you address me in this way?
How dare you come to me with these matters, and my
poor mother scarcely cold in death? Go! or I will summon
the servants to put you out!”</p>

<p>“Ah, you will? But before many days shall pass you
will find the tables turned with a vengeance. Violet Arleigh,
there is a dark cloud resting over your life, a cloud
which will never disappear, a stain that can not be wiped
out—the stain of black disgrace. When the time comes
for the truth to be known, how many of your present <i>dear
friends</i>, think you, will remain true? How many will rally
around you and stand by you through everything? My
word for it, you will not find one. When the truth comes
out, who will care for you and seek you for a wife? Not
your handsome lover, Leonard Yorke; and even if his
love is strong enough to stand the shock of the disgrace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
and exposure of your family secret, his mother—proud
Helen Yorke—would sooner see her only son dead than
wedded to you, the child of——”</p>

<p>“Hush! I forbid you to speak such words to me. I
forbid you to mention the name of Leonard Yorke.”</p>

<p>“Yes! Too good to pass the lips of a reprobate like
Gil Warrington, I suppose? But I know the world better
than you do, my dear Miss Arleigh, and I assure you
that, when this that I have to tell becomes known, when
the <i>truth</i> is made public, you will prove your friends then,
and my word for it, Leonard Yorke will not be among the
number. He will be the very first to desert you.”</p>

<p>“It is false! Mr. Warrington, I will hear no more of
this. Leave me! Have you no pity, no compassion for
me, whose mother lies upstairs dead and cold?”</p>

<p>An ugly sneer disfigured his face.</p>

<p>“Business before pleasure,” he returned, coarsely;
“and my errand with you admits of no delay. Once
more I ask you the question: Are you going to act a
submissive part, Miss Violet Arleigh, in that which is
before us?”</p>

<p>She turned away. She could not speak.</p>

<p>“Go!” she repeated, sternly, waving her hand in the
direction of the door. “I can bear no more of this.
Listen! Some one is coming to me now!”</p>

<p>There was a faint rap at the door of the room, and
then Leonard Yorke’s voice called softly:</p>

<p>“Violet! Violet! May I come in? Don’t stay there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
all alone, dear Violet! Open the door and let me come
in and comfort you.”</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington’s lips parted in a cruel smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure! Let him comfort you while he may,
my <i>dear</i> Violet! His days of comforting will soon be
at an end. You had better promise me what I ask,” he
added, harshly. “If you do not, you will be sorry. Say
yes—just the one word <i>yes</i>! Violet—I know that your
simple verbal promise will be as good as another person’s
guarantee—just say <i>yes</i>, and I will step out of the
window yonder and be gone before Mr. Leonard Yorke
suspects my presence here. You had better consent,
Violet.”</p>

<p>She stood hesitating, trembling, paling. Her whole
soul revolted from the bondage into which she would be
selling herself by this promise; for well she knew the
nature of the man with whom she had to deal—knew
that he was unscrupulous and a thorough villain. And
must she bind herself to obey him blindly? How did she
know to what evil purpose she was pledging herself?
He drew nearer, and grasping her arm once more, glared
down into her pale, frightened face.</p>

<p>“Promise me! Swear to obey me!” he hissed, bleakly.
“I will only require you to follow your mother’s instructions;
your mother who was—well, her letter tells you,
does it not, that she had a bad, black secret hidden away
in her past life, and that I alone shared that secret with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
her?—did she not write that in the letter that you have
just read?”</p>

<p>Violet’s head drooped, but the pale lips managed to
falter forth the two words:</p>

<p>“She did.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Then you will believe me and obey me?
Quick, Violet—your answer! Say <i>yes</i>, for Leonard
Yorke is determined to get into this room, and some one
is with him! Upon my word, that some one is Hilda
Rutledge! People say that Leonard thinks so much of
your cousin Hilda that he really does not know which of
you is the dearest. The door of this room is locked; but
he will continue to rap at it, and if you do not open it he
will summon the household and break it down. Speak,
Violet—at once! Do you promise to obey me? Is it
yes?”</p>

<p>She can hardly speak, she is so faint and frightened,
and the gaze of the basilisk eyes riveted upon her white
face seems to eat into her heart.</p>

<p>Tap, tap, at the door again, and once more Leonard’s
voice calls in tones of alarm:</p>

<p>“Violet, dear Violet, open the door! What is the matter?
Are you ill?”</p>

<p>And then the voice of Hilda Rutledge takes up the
refrain:</p>

<p>“Violet, dearest, unlock the door; we are all so frightened
about you. Come, dear!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Will you obey me?” hisses the serpent at her side.
“Is it yes?”</p>

<p>Her eyes, wild with horror, meet his; she sinks into a
seat.</p>

<p>“Yes!” she gasps, in a feeble whisper.</p>

<p>“Very well. Remember!”</p>

<p>With a look of triumph upon his evil face, Gilbert
Warrington leaps through the open window and disappears.</p>

<p>Violet staggers slowly to the door and unlocks it; then
she falls to the floor in a swoon.</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A STRANGE OCCURRENCE.</div>


<p>Leonard Yorke threw open the door of the library and
rushed into the room, Hilda following closely. His eyes
fell at once upon the huddled heap upon the floor. A
moment later he was kneeling beside the prostrate form,
clasping the poor girl in his arms.</p>

<p>“Violet! Violet!” he cried, eagerly, anxiously, “open
your eyes and let me hear you speak! Oh, Hilda, she
is dead!”</p>

<p>Hilda Rutledge made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! She has only fainted. Go and send
mamma here, we will attend to her.”</p>

<p>Leonard left the room, and Hilda bent over Violet and
began to rub her hands and bathe her temples. In one
hand, clasped tightly between the cold little fingers, was
the crumpled letter which had nearly broken Violet’s
heart. Hilda’s eyes scintillated.</p>

<p>“Ha! there is some mystery here!” she muttered. “I
must see the contents of that letter!”</p>

<p>But she could not remove it from Violet’s grasp; and
even while she was endeavoring to do so, the girl opened
her eyes. A fearful shudder passed over her.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” she faltered, brokenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“That man——”</p>

<p>Violet stopped abruptly, as memory came slowly back
to her. She struggled to a sitting posture just as Mrs.
Rutledge entered the room, looking pale and frightened.</p>

<p>“My dear child!” she began at once. “Oh, thank
Heaven, you are conscious! Come up to your own room,
Violet, and lie down. Yes, I insist upon it.”</p>

<p>Violet arose, and leaning upon her aunt’s arm, moved
slowly from the room.</p>

<p>Where was Leonard? Why had he deserted her? He
had not returned to the library, and Violet did not know
that he had been with her. Somehow, her heart sunk
with a vague alarm. Something in the fact of his absence
struck to her aching heart like a blow. Had he forgotten
her? Then he had ceased to care for her—had never
cared at all.</p>

<p>With all the usual inconsistency of a woman, she forgot
that only a few hours had elapsed since Leonard
Yorke’s avowal of love for her. How could he possibly
have changed in that short time?</p>

<p>It was the wild outreaching of the loving, lonely little
heart, and the intense disappointment that crushed down
upon it like a vise was almost more than she could bear.</p>

<p>Once in her own chamber, she begged her aunt and
cousin to leave her. The guests had, of course, long
since departed; only Leonard remained, as he felt that he
had a right to do. But Violet was ignorant of this fact,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
and so she misjudged him. Ah! if we only knew each
other’s motives, how different life would be! And Violet
never dreamed that Leonard had been forbidden by Mrs.
Rutledge to enter her presence, and, with natural delicacy,
the young man had held himself aloof.</p>

<p>Left alone in her own chamber, Violet’s first act was
to lock its door against possible intruders. Then she
placed the letter, which she still held in her hand, safely
away in her little writing-desk; and at that moment she
remembered the poem which Will Venners had given her—the
pretty love verses written for the eyes of Jessie
Glyndon alone. She searched in the lace of her corsage,
but the poem was gone. Still, it was nothing of vital importance,
and in the presence of the awful affliction which
had come upon her and that other trouble which
she felt certain was about to come into her life through
Gilbert Warrington, she thought no more about it.</p>

<p>And little did she dream of the important part which
that poem was destined to play in her own future. Little
things sometimes sway and alter our whole lives. The
veriest trifle may possibly work great and stupendous results.
The mouse gnaws the rope which sets the prisoner
free; a file can sever iron bars; a word in due season, how
much good it can accomplish! Life is made up of trifles,
after all. Victor Hugo maintains that had it not been for
the small circumstance of a shower of rain, Napoleon
would not have lost Waterloo, and the fate of two great
nations might have been vastly different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Down-stairs, in the deserted library, Leonard Yorke
was pacing to and fro, his face pale and full of trouble.
Something indefinable haunted him; a feeling of doubt, of
<i>distrust</i> regarding Violet had taken possession of his
heart. Leonard was by nature inclined to be jealous, and
Hilda had contrived to arouse his latent jealousy.</p>

<p>Leonard thought it all over—all his supposed grounds
for distrust of Violet—and his heart grew heavy. His
mother, too, did not like Violet, and was always trying to
influence her son against the girl, though this Violet never
suspected.</p>

<p>Up and down he paced restlessly, impatient for news
of Violet before he would go home. Yorke Towers was
some two miles distant from The Oaks, and he was determined
to remain until he was assured of his darling’s
recovery from the indisposition which had prostrated her.
As he paced slowly up and down the library, his eyes fell
upon a folded paper lying upon the floor, just under the
edge of a sofa. He stooped mechanically and picked it up.
It was a closely written sheet of note-paper, evidently
verses. Leonard Yorke’s brow contracted with an angry
frown as he recognized Will Venners’ plain, elegant
chirography—the gallant young captain who had seen
service under Custer in the far West, but now seemed
more at home in luxurious drawing-rooms at the feet of
beauty. To sum it all up in a few words, Will Venners
was the only man whom Leonard feared as a rival.</p>

<p>He stood there now slowly turning over the poem which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Will had so carefully written to the woman he loved. But
how was Leonard to know that it was meant for Jessie
Glyndon? Had he not seen Captain Venners slip the
paper into Violet’s willing hand out in the moonlight on
the river-bank, when neither of them thought themselves
observed? A hot flood of anger swelled Leonard
Yorke’s heart. Slowly he read the lines, and as he read,
the anger grew and strengthened:</p>

<p>With a muttered imprecation, Leonard Yorke thrust
the paper into his pocket and hastened from the room.
In the hall outside he encountered Miss Rutledge. Upstairs,
in the chamber of death, the body of Rosamond
Arleigh was being prepared for its last resting-place. The
house was very still; the awful shadow of death rested
over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Below stairs, the servants with busy hands were removing
all traces of the ball—the faded garlands and
drooping evergreens, the <i>débris</i> of the supper. Everything
was done in a swift, silent fashion to restore the house to
its usual order and decorum; and the drawing-room,
where only a few hours before merriment had reigned
supreme, was being prepared to receive the body of the
mistress of The Oaks. The burial casket was already
ordered, and in a short time the place which had known
Rosamond Arleigh would know her no more.</p>

<p>“You look tired and troubled, Leonard,” began Mrs.
Rutledge, kindly. “Come and have some coffee. You are
not able to ride home now.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear Mrs. Rutledge,” he returned, “but I
could not take anything, and I think I had better go home
at once. Miss Glyndon will break the sad news to my
mother, and she will be looking anxiously for me. Can I
do anything for you—or”—with a slight hesitation—“for
Violet?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge shook her head.</p>

<p>“I will let you know, my dear boy, if there should be
anything for you to do,” she returned. “You will come
back soon?”</p>

<p>“I will; to-night or to-morrow morning. And now
good-bye.”</p>

<p>He pressed her hand warmly, and mounting his horse,
rode swiftly away back to Yorke Towers.</p>

<p>The day passed, and Violet kept her own room. Leonard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
did not return that night, and no intelligence came
from Yorke Towers.</p>

<p>Night came down calm and still, and when everybody
had retired to their own rooms, Violet Arleigh stole from
her chamber and went softly down-stairs to the drawing-room,
where her mother lay sleeping the long, last sleep—never
to open her eyes again upon the scenes of this
world; never to speak a loving word to her child; to lie in
the cold, dark grave alone with the worm and corruption.
Violet’s heart bled at the thought. She opened the drawing-room
door softly, and entering, crept to the side of the
couch upon which the body lay.</p>

<p>The burial casket would not arrive until a late hour that
night, so the body had been placed upon a low couch
strewn with fragrant flowers. In an adjoining room,
Doctor Danton and a grave-faced man, a stranger to Violet,
sat alone. No one else kept watch, for it was a special
request of the old physician. He had been Rosamond
Arleigh’s medical adviser for years, and was like a brother
to her. Violet crept to the side of the couch where the
cold form was lying, and knelt down. She buried her face
upon the pillow beside the cold cheek.</p>

<p>“Mamma, mamma!” wailed the girl in broken accents.
“Come back to me, mamma, for oh, I can not live without
you!”</p>

<p>It was the burden of her cry—a cry which has gone
up from many an aching heart, but all in vain. The
words died upon her lips in a stifled groan. Powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
above! could it be true? Was her brain turning, or had
she imagined it? Surely—surely she had seen the eyelids
flutter, and something like a feeble respiration stirred
the snowy linen on Rosamond Arleigh’s breast.</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">GONE!</div>


<p>Pale and trembling with excitement, Violet knelt at the
side of the body, her eyes fastened with burning intensity
upon the white, still face. Had she deceived herself, or
did she really see the linen upon her mother’s breast move
slightly? Who has not imagined similar improbabilities
when gazing upon the corpse of a loved one? The closed
eyes seem striving to open, the chest appears to rise and
fall; even one may fancy that the breath flutters feebly
from between the parted lips. But what Violet Arleigh
saw as she knelt at the side of the couch was this: A
shiver seemed to run over the still, rigid form, and one
hand, lying upon the breast, <i>moved</i> slightly. With a
stifled cry, the girl started to her feet, and rushing to
the door of the room where the physician sat, threw it
open.</p>

<p>“Doctor Danton!”—her voice low and awe-stricken—“for
the love of Heaven, come to my mother; she is——”</p>

<p>The physician raised the fore-finger of his right hand
and laid it lightly upon her lips with a gesture of silence.</p>

<p>“Hush!” he whispered, cautiously; “do not let any
one hear you, Violet. Listen to me. You have known
me all your life; you know that Rosamond Arleigh was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
very dear to me; you will believe me when I say that
I have good reason to believe that a terrible crime has
been attempted.”</p>

<p>“<i>Doctor Danton!</i>”</p>

<p>Her voice rang out in wild alarm.</p>

<p>“It is true, my dear. It is so apparently true, and I
am so fully convinced of foul play, that I have taken certain
steps in the matter. Wait a moment, my child; I
will explain all when I have looked at your mother.”</p>

<p>He stepped swiftly, noiselessly to the side of the couch,
and gazed long and earnestly into the still, white face.
The doctor nodded gravely. He was a fine-looking man
of middle age, with a face that any woman would trust,
with its deep, gray eyes, and dark hair just touched with
silver.</p>

<p>“It is as I thought,” he said.</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a small leathern case, and
opening it, selected a vial from the half dozen that it
contained. He proceeded to pour a few drops between
the teeth of the supposed dead woman.</p>

<p>“Violet, my child”—the doctor lifted his head, and
his eyes met the bewildered gaze of the girl—“I do not
like to raise false hopes in your heart, but I believe, I
truly believe, that there is a hope of saving your mother
yet. I do not think that she is dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank God! thank God! Let me go and call
Aunt Constance at once.”</p>

<p>“Not for your life!” Doctor Danton’s hand came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
down upon the girl’s shoulder. “Stop!” he commanded;
“listen to me! If I restore Rosamond Arleigh
to life once more, no one must know or suspect the
truth—no one but yourself and the gentleman in the
room yonder. Violet, he is a detective.”</p>

<p>“A—detective?” gasped the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes; and an exceedingly clever one at that. I sent
for him to keep watch with me to-night, having first,
with some difficulty, induced Mrs. Rutledge to consent
to leave everything to me. But first I administered a
potion to your mother which will restore circulation and
keep her in this condition until I can go to work properly
in the case. Violet, I believe that some one has attempted
her life. The empty chloral bottle was placed
at her side to give the impression that she had died from
an overdose of chloral, taken accidentally or with design.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! Doctor Danton, my mother would
never have been guilty of suicide.”</p>

<p>“I know it, my dear. She desired to live for your
sake. But how can we convince the public of that?
Neither I nor any of the other attending physicians
could find anything that would justify a verdict of suicide;
and I, noting something unusual about the body,
and acting upon certain hints in regard to her condition
lately given me by your mother, have ventured to take
the course that I have taken. I made a clean breast of
the affair to Mr. Dunbar, the famous detective. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
result is that he is here to-night, and his suspicions are
fully aroused as to the evidence of an attempted crime.
Violet, can you be strong and brave, and control your
nerves? Will you be obedient? Can you help me in
everything, for your mother’s sake?”</p>

<p>The great tears rushed into the girl’s dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Try me—try me!” she cried. “Oh, Doctor Danton,
I would do <i>anything</i> for my dear mother!”</p>

<p>“I knew it. Well, then, the first thing you must do
is to go straight upstairs to your own room and go to
bed.”</p>

<p>“Doctor!”</p>

<p>“You have promised to be obedient, Violet. Now
trust me. I believe that I can resuscitate your mother,
but no one outside must know it, if you would apprehend
her would-be murderer. I want you to appear, and be,
perfectly ignorant of all that takes place. I will inform
you of all that transpires—all the results—as soon as
possible. Trust me, Violet.”</p>

<p>“I will—I do!” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“Listen; this is my plan: everybody must believe that
your mother is really dead. I have given her a potion
which will keep her quiet, and no one will suspect the
truth. The potion must be administered every two hours,
or the effect will wear off. I intend to keep her as she is
at present for a few hours. In the meantime, Dunbar
and I will fill the coffin with lead and bricks, and it shall
be buried. The funeral is appointed for ten in the morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
you know. The coffin must be buried, and the public
be blinded to the fact that it contains no body, otherwise
the murderer will escape. I will arrange so that the lid
shall be fastened down, and no one will be permitted to
open it. Then, when everything is ready, I will have your
mother’s unconscious body taken to my house, and there
she shall be restored to health, that she may punish and
expose her would-be murderer. Violet, I believe from the
bottom of my heart, that this man, Gilbert Warrington,
was the man who attempted your mother’s life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven!”</p>

<p>“I believe it. But it can not be proven without her
assistance, no matter how clever a detective we hire.”</p>

<p>“But,” panted Violet, wildly, “what object would
Gilbert Warrington have to attempt such a crime? It
does not seem——”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> quite possible,” interrupted the physician,
hastily. “He has been her evil genius for years, though
what is the secret of the power that he holds over her I
could never learn. She guarded it as though it would be
death to reveal it. I have begged her to confide in me—to
give me the right to protect her—but she refused absolutely,
and went on in silence, with that black secret,
whatever it may be, hanging over her head like a shadow.
I believe that Warrington has hounded her down to her
death. I believe that he has attempted her murder, and
then, wishing to throw suspicion upon her and make the
world believe that she committed suicide, he placed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
chloral bottle at her side. He was her bitter enemy in
life, and in death would blacken her good name. Violet,
what was Gilbert Warrington to your mother? Do you
know or suspect?”</p>

<p>Violet shook her head. A slow horror stole over her
heart as she remembered her promise to obey this villain
implicitly in whatever he might bid her to do in regard to
her future. This promise was binding; to a girl like Violet
Arleigh it seemed impossible to break a solemn obligation.
But she trembled with terror, and her heart was
sore afraid.</p>

<p>“Go to your own room, Violet,” continued the physician,
after a pause. “Dunbar and I will attend to the
rest. You must try and sleep, too. Remember, my dear,
that your mother <i>is not dead</i>, and all that human power
can do shall be done for her. Good-night, my dear.”</p>

<p>Violet laid her hand in his. He stooped and kissed
the girl’s pale cheek. Then she left the room and hastened
upstairs to her own chamber. Her heart was full
to overflowing with a wild, mad joy. Her mother would
be restored to her in time, and together they would hunt
down that wretch, Gilbert Warrington, to his just punishment.</p>

<p>Down-stairs Doctor Danton and the detective sat conversing
for awhile in low, eager tones. Outside the
grounds of The Oaks, near a rear entrance, a closed carriage
had been waiting for a half-hour or more, the
driver on the box waiting with calm patience for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
coming of his master. Danton and Dunbar were busily
arranging every detail of the hard work before them,
going carefully over every point lest there be some misunderstanding,
which, even though slight, might wreck
the whole plot. Doctor Danton glanced at the clock on
the mantel at last.</p>

<p>“It is nearly one o’clock,” he exclaimed, in a cautious
tone. “It is quite time for us to start, Dunbar; and
I heard Tom’s whistle a moment ago, which proves that
my faithful coachman is in waiting. I will wrap Mrs.
Arleigh up in a cloak and carry her out to the carriage,
and we will drive like mad to my house. You remain
here to close the coffin lid. In your assumed character
of my assistant, no one will recognize the eminent New
Orleans detective. Mrs. Rutledge must be told in the
morning—I will be back here to do it—that on account
of decomposition the body must not be exposed. I think
that we will be able to carry out our plans. Only one
must be very, very careful, for one little slip will ruin all.
And——”</p>

<p>He came to a startled halt. The two men had entered
the room where Rosamond Arleigh’s supposed corpse lay
upon the couch. But there was nothing there; <i>the body
was gone</i>!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A MAD MISTAKE.</div>


<p>Rosamond Arleigh opened her eyes. It was as still as
death within the room which had been prepared to receive
her body. The mirrors were draped in white; there were
bouquets of white flowers, white roses, bridal wreath,
and lilies, pure white, and long-throated, pink-tinted
lilies. A faint, sickening perfume pervaded the apartment,
and over the whole house a dead silence rested.</p>

<p>How long she had lain in that state she did not know.
She had been dimly conscious of Violet’s presence there,
knew that the girl was sobbing forth her name, calling
upon her mother to come back to her, to stand at her side
in the hard battle with the cold, cruel world. Come back
to her! Where had she, Rosamond, been? For a whole
hour she had lain there without moving a muscle, her
thoughts—strange, wild, disconnected—wandering back
over the past, trying to disentangle the threads, and
smooth out the fabric of her life; but all was confused,
dim, irregular. All at once the sound of a voice fell upon
her ears, speaking in low, eager tones; it was Doctor
Danton.</p>

<p>“I wonder what Jack Danton is doing here?” Mrs.
Arleigh said to herself, with a hazy impression that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
hour was very late. “I believe he is speaking to Violet.
Poor child, she ought to be in bed. She must be greatly
fatigued after—after her ball.”</p>

<p>The ball! There! She has come back to first principles
now; and now Rosamond Arleigh begins to untangle
the web which is woven about her brain. She remembers
the scene in her own sitting-room between herself
and Gilbert Warrington. She recalls it all, every
word, every look, every gesture. It struck home to her
understanding, her memory, with the sharpness of a
knife. The poor woman uttered a low cry, and struggled
to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>Doctor Danton had by this time induced Violet to go
to bed, and he had returned to the next room and the
company of Dunbar, closing the door of communication
between the two apartments.</p>

<p>Rosamond sat up on the flower-strewn couch and stared
wildly about her. Was she dead? Was her body really
bereft of life; and this, that was thinking and troubling
itself so, was it her freed spirit, anxious to soar away, yet
earth-bound still? It was a strange, a grewsome thought.</p>

<p>Trembling like a leaf, she rose to her feet. They had
arranged the supposed dead body in a simple robe of
snowy lawn trimmed with lace. There was nothing suggestive
of a shroud in the garment, yet Rosamond’s eyes,
as they rested upon it, closed involuntarily, and a shudder
passed over her. A swift, wild thought flashed into
her brain. Remember, it was not yet quite clear, nor had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
she recovered entirely from the effects of her recent attack
and the strange experience which had followed
it. Let any woman, no matter how strong her nerves,
open her eyes and realize that the world believes her
dead, that she is robed for the grave, and over in a corner
of the room her <i>coffin</i> stands waiting to receive her body,
and my word for it, she would be guilty of quite as insane
conduct as that of which Rosamond Arleigh is guilty
now.</p>

<p>And the circumstances which surround Rosamond
were so strange and unusual, she had become the victim
of such remarkable events, so wildly romantic, no wonder
her weak nerves had failed her now and she had given
way. Her brain was giddy with the crowd of thoughts
and fancies which beset it; she was possessed of but one
aim—a wild, mad resolution to escape forever from Gilbert
Warrington’s power—even though to do this—to
gain her freedom—she would only find it in the grave.</p>

<p>She wrung her white hands frantically.</p>

<p>“He has blighted my whole life, and I hate him!” she
moaned. “I will escape from him now while I can. He
will return here in the morning, and—and I must be gone.
He has hounded me down, blackened my life with that
awful story of disgrace and shame. I must get away
from here, I must escape <i>him</i>, or I shall die indeed. He
thinks me dead now, and indeed I would be if I had not
had the strength and courage to empty the contents of the
chloral bottle upon the floor when he pressed it to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
lips. I will try to escape; I must. I will go to Yorke
Towers; it is there that I must seek for those papers,
there, where Harold Arleigh—oh, Harold, Harold, my
darling!—lived at the time to which Gilbert Warrington
refers. For Yorke Towers was long in possession of the
Arleighs. I think that is the real cause of Helen Yorke’s
ill-concealed dislike for me. But outwardly she is my
friend, and I am certain she can not refuse to aid me if
I lay the case before her and beg her to do so. Even
her jealousy of the Arleighs must disappear in the presence
of this great calamity. Yes, I will go to Yorke
Towers to-night, and Gilbert Warrington will never find
me, never dream that I am hidden away at Yorke Towers,
or that I still live!”</p>

<p>Her brain, dazed and weak, was incapable of sound
reasoning. She was nearly bereft of reasoning powers,
and on the very verge of insanity. Small wonder that
her actions were henceforth those of a maniac. Had she
only known it, there were true hearts and helping hands
in the very next room, eager and anxious to strike a blow
for her sake. But she did not know, and so, like many
another short-sighted mortal, looked far away for that
which was within her reach. And so the mad mistake
was made which neither time nor endeavor could rectify.
Slowly and feebly she staggered across the room. In
her white robe she looked like a spirit. Her eyes fell
upon a long, dark cloak which Doctor Danton had placed
upon a chair, and which he had intended to wrap about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
her when he would carry her out to the waiting carriage.
She remembered in a hazy sort of way that she had heard
Doctor Danton say something about his carriage in waiting
at the rear entrance of The Oaks, and the swift determination
formed itself within her brain to reach the
carriage and order the driver to drive her over to Yorke
Towers. Once there——</p>

<p>Her bewildered brain could go no further in the reasoning
process; but something, she knew not what, urged
her on to reach Yorke Towers that night.</p>

<p>Something! Was it fate?</p>

<p>Slowly and hesitatingly, trembling like an aspen, Rosamond
threw the cloak about her shoulders and drew the
hood over her head; then, with wavering, uncertain steps,
her feet clad only in thin silk stockings and dainty slippers,
she made her way over to the window, which stood
open and led out upon the lawn. She stepped forth into
the cool, calm night. The soft air fanned her cheeks and
made her brain grow clearer.</p>

<p>She glanced swiftly, with eyes full of terror, up at the
house—her own home, from which she was flying as from
a pestilence, turning her back upon her best, her only
friends, in the mad delirium of her clouded intellect.</p>

<p>Drawing the cloak closely about her, she darted away
like a bird in the direction of the rear entrance to the
grounds of The Oaks.</p>

<p>Just outside the windows of the room where she had
been lying, to all appearance dead, there was a tiny arbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
covered with honeysuckle all in bloom. Within the arbor
the dark figure of a man had been sitting for the last hour
or two, buried in meditation and cigar-smoke. Now, as
the slight form wrapped in the long, dark cloak stepped
softly from the window, and the gleaming lamp-light
from within the room streamed full across her face, he
started to his feet with a stifled exclamation. He tossed
his half-smoked cigar into the shrubbery near, and turning
upon his heel, followed the flying figure with long,
hurried strides.</p>

<p>She never dreamed that she was pursued. If she had,
she would have fallen dead at his feet, for life was burning
with but a feeble flame within her heart. Poor Rosamond
could not endure much more. But, blissfully unconscious,
she made her way straight on with surprising
celerity for one who had lain for hours in a comatose condition—on,
on, until at last the rear entrance was safely
gained. She opened the little gate with swift, eager
hands; and the moment consumed in this action gave her
pursuer time to reach her side, only he kept hidden from
view, and she never for a moment suspected that she was
not alone. Over and over she kept whispering to herself,
as her clouded brain revolved the situation:</p>

<p>“I must get away—anywhere, anywhere! I must not
stay here, for Gilbert Warrington will find me, and he will
claim me. And, oh, God, I would far rather be dead than
his wife! Yorke Towers is my safe refuge. Surely,
Helen Yorke will help me to hide from Gilbert Warrington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
and to find the lost papers which will give me back
my own again. There is a room at Yorke Towers called
the haunted room. If only she will let me stay there and
hide, I shall be safe—safe—safe! But here I would be
persecuted until I would have to take my own life to escape
from him. I <i>must</i> reach Yorke Towers to-night. I
must—I must!”</p>

<p>She had unfastened the little gate at last, and flitted
through like a bird. Her pursuer darts after her, and
closing the gate, locks it, and flings the key far out into
the little strip of woodland which belts the road.</p>

<p>It was still as death out here, only the occasional cry
of a belated night-bird and the monotonous cheep, cheep,
cheep of a cricket hidden in the tall grass near by to break
the silence.</p>

<p>On, like a wild creature—for she is afraid of the night
and the lonely darkness—Rosamond Arleigh flies; the
man who is in pursuit of her keeps close in her wake—on,
on!</p>

<p>Half hidden by a clump of great live-oaks, Doctor
Danton’s carriage stands patiently waiting, its driver,
Tom, a faithful negro, nodding upon the box.</p>

<p>All at once Tom became conscious of a slight, dark-robed
figure, and a woman’s voice broke the silence, calling
swiftly, softly:</p>

<p>“Drive me to Yorke Towers at once. Quick, quick!
Lose no time!”</p>

<p>Then the dark-robed figure stepped swiftly, noiselessly—“jes’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
like a ghos’!” so poor Tom was wont to declare—into
the carriage, and the door was shut.</p>

<p>Tom gathered up his reins obediently, and turned his
horses’ heads about. But at that moment a stinging blow
descended upon his head; heaven and earth seemed to
come together with a shock. Some one, or <i>something</i>—for
Tom afterward described the apparition as a tall black
man, with fiery eyes and a tail; in fact, a veritable Satan—seized
him in an iron grip, and he felt himself descending
rapidly earthward. Another concussion, as something
struck him upon the head and chest, then darkness—the
very blackness of darkness—gathered over him, and Tom
knew no more.</p>

<p>Prone upon the ground, under the clump of oaks, he lay
until he was rescued later on by Doctor Danton and
Dunbar.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the tall dark figure that had pursued
Rosamond Arleigh from the grounds of The Oaks and
into the carriage had mounted on the box in Tom’s place,
and was driving Doctor Danton’s horses like mad—but
<i>not</i> in the direction of Yorke Towers.</p>

<div class="chaptitle">“MY DARK-EYED WILL!”</div>


<p>When Leonard Yorke reached home after the tragic
occurrence at The Oaks, he was met in the hall by Jessie
Glyndon. She was very pale, and her eyes bore the traces
of recent weeping.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Yorke,” she began, as soon as she saw him,
“your mother is very ill! When I arrived home from
The Oaks and broke to her the news of Mrs. Arleigh’s
sudden death, she was fearfully overcome. She had retired,
of course; but she was not sleeping, and as I passed
through the hall she heard me and called me. I went to
her, and then I told her what had taken place. She grew
as pale as death, and started up in bed, as though about
to arise, and her eyes looked wild and frightened, and she
trembled in every limb.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, no, no!’ she cried, piteously, looking up into
my face with <i>such</i> a pleading look, and something like
terror—actual terror. ‘Rosamond Arleigh is not dead—not
dead! Don’t say that she is dead, Jessie! Heaven
forbid! for then it would be too late—too late for reparation!’</p>

<p>“And then she fell back upon the pillow in a dead
faint, and it was a full hour before the housekeeper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
I could restore her. We sent for Doctor Danton. He
was at The Oaks; but his assistant came, and at last she
is quiet and has fallen asleep. Come into the breakfast-room,
Mr. Yorke; you look completely worn out. I have
ordered breakfast served.”</p>

<p>He followed her obediently. He could not speak, for
his heart was too full. Leonard Yorke’s mother was the
dearest thing on earth to him, except the girl he loved,
and the thought that she was ill cut his tender heart like
a knife. He went into the breakfast-room and seated
himself mechanically at the small round table covered
with snowy damask and glittering with delicate china and
costly silver. Jessie Glyndon began to pour the fragrant
coffee from the steaming silver urn, and as she waited
upon him, Leonard’s eyes rested carelessly upon her face.
She was not a beauty, but the face was full of interest.
Tall and regal in figure, she had a pale, colorless complexion,
lighted up by deep-gray eyes. Her hair was golden-brown.
Somehow, as her slender hands fluttered in and
out among the silver breakfast service, Leonard felt a
thrill of interest in his mother’s companion which he had
never felt before.</p>

<p>“Miss Glyndon,” he began, abruptly, “are you familiar
with Captain Venners’ handwriting?”</p>

<p>A swift crimson flushed her pale cheek, her head
drooped, and her eyes studied the pattern of the pretty
green-and-white carpet at her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“I? Yes, I believe that I know it very well. Why do
you ask, Mr. Yorke?”</p>

<p>Leonard’s face grew stern.</p>

<p>“Because I have found a poem which I think he wrote,”
he returned, slowly—“a poem dropped upon the floor of
the library at The Oaks by Violet Arleigh, the woman I
love. Will you look at it, Miss Glyndon? Perhaps you
can settle the question. For my part, I am confident that
Will Venners wrote it.”</p>

<p>He had drawn the unfortunate poem from his pocket as
he spoke—poor Will’s labor of love, which was destined
to reach the one for whom it had been intended at last,
but not in the way that he had expected, nor the results
which truth compels us to record. Jessie Glyndon drew
back a little, and her face was very pale.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Yorke, I don’t care to see it,” she was beginning;
but something in Leonard’s swift glance of surprise
stung her woman’s pride, and she took the poem
from his hand.</p>

<p>Slowly she read it, and as she read it over with the belief
that it was written for Violet Arleigh—that the sweet,
tender words were meant for another woman, a stern,
cold look settled down upon Jessie’s face, and her heart
grew hard as a stone toward dark-eyed Will. When she
reached the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And I thought, ‘Love’s soul is not in fetters;</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Neither space nor time keeps souls apart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Since I can not, dare not, send my letters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Through the silence I will send my heart,’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>
<p>she laid the poem abruptly down upon the table and
turned away.</p>

<p>“Well,” queried Leonard, with a ring of impatience
in his voice, “is it Will Venners’ work, Miss Glyndon?
Do you identify the writing?”</p>

<p>Her heart was beating eighteen to the dozen, and she
felt a strange, cold sensation creeping over her; but with
a wonderful effort she controlled her agitation, and the
voice which made answer did not even tremble as she
replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, it is Will—Captain Venners’—handwriting, Mr.
Yorke; I know it.”</p>

<p>Leonard pushed back the empty coffee-cup from beside
his plate.</p>

<p>“Then, by Heaven!—I beg your pardon, Miss Glyndon—what
does he mean by writing such stuff to Violet—Miss
Arleigh? I may as well tell you now as later that I
fully expected to make her my wife!”</p>

<p>“He would not have <i>dared</i> to write poems to her if she
did not encourage him!” cried Jessie, indignantly, with
all a woman’s bitter judgment of her sister-woman whom
she believes to have come between herself and happiness.
“Of course Miss Arleigh was willing, or Will Venners
would never have spent all the time necessary to write a
poem—a lengthy one like that—to bestow upon her. You
know how indolent he is. A man with great natural ability
and talent, he requires an incentive—some deep motive
to interest and urge him on. He must certainly have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
cared for, and believed that he had a right to care for, the
woman for whom these lines were written!”</p>

<p>Ah, Jessie! quick-tempered, swift to judge, sensitive to
a fault, you have spoken truly! The pretty lines <i>were</i>
written for the woman whom Will Venners loved, but not
for Violet Arleigh.</p>

<p>It was a sad mistake all around, as complete a game of
cross-purposes as one would wish to see.</p>

<p>Miss Glyndon returned Will Venners’ unfortunate
poem to Leonard Yorke, then with her head very erect
and a round red spot burning like a flame upon each pale
cheek, she left the breakfast-room and slowly ascended
the great circular stair-case which led from the immense
entrance hall up to regions above. A few moments later
she opened the door of a pretty sleeping-room all in pale
pink and white—her own <i>sanctum</i>—for here at Yorke
Towers the hired companion was as well lodged and as
kindly treated as an honored guest.</p>

<p>Miss Glyndon locked the door behind her, then she
went straight over to an old-fashioned <i>escritoire</i> which
stood beside an open window, and took from a small
drawer a package of letters. Not many, nor were they
very lengthy, but they had been carefully preserved, bound
with the orthodox blue ribbon, and each letter bore the
signature, “<i>Yours, as ever, Will.</i>”</p>

<p>Seating herself, she glanced over them. Not a word
of love in any of them, oh, no! but there was a certain
something in the tone, and an occasional word which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
pen let slip, which betrayed strong inner feelings. Their
perusal sent the red blood into the reader’s pale cheeks,
and made the gray eyes grow misty. When the last one
was read, she laid the package upon the <i>escritoire</i>, and
going over to the mantel, took from a small silver easel
a photograph of Will Venners. One long, long look.
I am afraid to attempt to translate the hidden meaning
of that eager, devouring gaze. She pressed the pictured
face to her lips.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, fair sweet dream,” she whispered, “my
dark-eyed Will, good-bye! Yet—no, he was not mine, he
was never mine” (the gray eyes flashed wrathfully);
“he has only been amusing himself with me, the poor dependent—Mrs.
Yorke’s hired companion. He is an outrageous
flirt, I have known it all the time, yet still—fool
that I have been—I have allowed myself to dream, and to
be led on and on, to believe him, to—to—oh, Will, Will, I
wish I were dead and could forget you! I shall have to
be dead before I <i>can</i> forget you, my beautiful, dark-eyed
lover! So that dream is over.”</p>

<p>With trembling hands she placed the photograph with
its bright smiling face and firm, sweet mouth upon the
package of letters, a regular funeral pyre. Then with set
lips and cold, shaking hands she placed the entire package
in a large envelope, sealed it decisively, and addressed
it in a plain hand to “Captain Will Venners, Southern
Athletic Club, New Orleans, La.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Two hours later it was on its way to New Orleans and
its unhappy recipient, who immediately on its receipt decided
that this world is a delusion and a snare, and life is
not worth living.</p>

<div class="chaptitle">ESCAPED.</div>


<p>Doctor Danton’s carriage dashed away like mad, and
the man on the box smiled grimly to himself as he guided
the spirited horses onward down the long, white country
road which led to an adjacent town.</p>

<p>“A bold stroke, and a sure one,” Gilbert Warrington
muttered. “If ever the devil helped his own, he has extended
the right hand of fellowship to me to-night. She
is safe in my care now, and I imagine that I can find a
way to make her hold her tongue. Otherwise, she will
tell her pathetic, her strangely romantic story to the nearest
magistrate, and my game will be up. As long as I can
keep her out of the way, keep her safely concealed from
the eyes of the world, I shall have everything in my own
hands. She will keep silent—she will have to—and I
shall control the fortune. With only that girl to manage,
there will be little trouble, I think. If I could have had
my own way with Rosamond”—he went on thoughtfully,
after a brief pause, during which he turned the horses’
heads into a new road, and applied the whip-lash lightly to
their backs as he did so—“I would have made her my
wife, and then all would have gone finely. But she hates
me so—the little spitfire—that she could not endure my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
presence. Not that I mind her hatred so much, either;
but it would have been <i>sauce piquante</i> to me; but I could
not gain her consent. Neither persuasion, threats, nor
intimidation had any effect upon her; she was firm, and
not afraid of me. Because she was in her own house, surrounded
by friends (old Danton would give his eyes for
her); it will be quite different now, with her in my absolute
power. Ah! my dear, you will live to regret the hour
when you scorned Gil Warrington.”</p>

<p>On went the carriage as though pursued by demons—on,
on! Rosamond Arleigh, nestling among the cushions
inside, began to think that it was time that Yorke Towers
was reached. Opening the carriage door softly, she called
aloud:</p>

<p>“Driver!”</p>

<p>The carriage did not halt; its speed was unchecked.
Once more she called loudly in accents of terror, a strange
horror beginning to tug at her heart-strings.</p>

<p>“Driver! Stop! Stop a moment!”</p>

<p>There was danger that the sound of her voice in its
wild appeal might reach the ears of a chance passer, although
at this hour, in this lonely country place, there was
little danger. But still she might contrive to make herself
heard by somebody. The very thought drove the life-blood
from about Gilbert Warrington’s craven heart.</p>

<p>In a pretty clump of woodland he halted the carriage.
Making up his mind that now was the time to reveal himself
to his prisoner, he got down from the box and approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
the carriage door. Rosamond had unfastened it
and sat clutching the handle desperately, with a suddenly
aroused instinct of terror. She had felt so safe with
Tom, the old negro coachman, whom she knew would
drive her over to Yorke Towers, or any other place that
she might request; though, of course, Tom never dreamed
that the lady in the carriage was the supposed dead
woman, the preparations for whose funeral were going
on at The Oaks. Had such a suspicion intruded upon his
mind, he would not have held the reins a moment in the
service of a ghost, or a “h’ant,” as the negroes call it.
But Tom had only observed that it was a woman, and she
had requested him to drive her to Yorke Towers. It must
be Miss Glyndon, or some friend of the Arleighs. Of
course, he did not hesitate, therefore, to obey her orders.
But there followed the attack upon him, and being totally
unprepared for such a calamity, Tom was, of course, perfectly
useless. And all this time Rosamond, crouching
within the carriage, eager and anxious to reach Yorke
Towers, and stand face to face with Helen Yorke, to demand
an explanation of a certain mystery, never dreamed
that Tom was not upon the box of the carriage. Had she
known the truth before, it would have driven her mad.
Her poor brain was even now trembling in the balance
between reason and insanity. It would not take much
of a blow to quite deprive her of reason.</p>

<p>As Gilbert Warrington opened the carriage door, Rosamond
started up, pale and eager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Tom, this is not the road to Yorke Towers!” she exclaimed,
wildly. “What do you mean? I will report
you to Doctor Danton. Drive me to Yorke Towers at
once. This is the road to Belleville. How dare you disobey
my orders in this way? I—— Oh, my God! my
God!”</p>

<p>For a gleam of the dying moonlight falling athwart the
man’s face revealed the truth—and Gilbert Warrington.</p>

<p>He smiled, and his white teeth had a wolfish gleam as
they glittered in the pallid moon rays.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, you see how useless it is to hope to
escape me,” he cried. “Even <i>death</i> itself has no power
to separate us.”</p>

<p>But still she sat staring into his hated face with eyes
full of horror and detestation.</p>

<p>“Heaven help me!” she moaned under her breath.</p>

<p>He laughed a hard, sneering laugh.</p>

<p>“Heaven will not help you,” he cried; “there is no
help for you. Back, Rosamond Arleigh!” for she had
sprung lightly forward, as though to leap from the carriage.
“Back, I say, or I will have your life!”</p>

<p>With a swift movement he pushed her back into the
vehicle, closed its door, and sprung upon the box. A moment
later they were flying onward through the dusky
shadows—the dark hour which comes just before day. It
was a dark hour to poor Rosamond Arleigh. She
crouched down once more among the cushions and gave
herself up to bitter reflections. Surely Heaven had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
turned a deaf ear upon her, and would not hear or heed
her prayers. She was lost—lost! An awful horror seized
her. What would become of her? Where would he take
her? What would be her fate? She closed her eyes as a
deadly faintness stole over her and weakened her heart
and paralyzed her brain. Lost, lost! No hope for her
now. Heaven had forsaken her; she was in Gilbert
Warrington’s power. A dull apathy began to steal over
her and deprive her of reason. But the thought of her
innocent child left to the machinations of this villain
aroused her, and in a moment her mind was made up.</p>

<p>“I will make one bold stroke for freedom, though I
perish in the attempt,” she said, resolutely.</p>

<p>The carriage was going at a furious pace. Close by was
a deep, dark stream brawling onward amid fallen trees
and <i>débris</i>, between high, steep banks. Rosamond remembered
it, and knew that they were obliged to slacken
pace to cross the narrow bridge which spanned the stream
further on. They reached the bridge. She opened the
carriage door softly, and made a swift, mad leap out and
downward. As she touched the steep bank of the stream,
the soft, sandy earth crumbled and gave way. Down she
went—down to the swift, swirling flood below, followed
by a shower of dislodged earth and stones! Down,
down! And the carriage crossed the bridge and dashed
on.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A MYSTERY.</div>


<p>The steep bank of sandy earth gave way and precipitated
Rosamond Arleigh downward—down, down! She
closed her eyes and gave herself up for lost. On, on
she went, until at last she struck the water with a splash,
and all was still.</p>

<p>On, on over the narrow bridge, and away in the direction
of Belleville, Doctor Danton’s horses went tearing
like mad—on, as though pursued by demons. And the
face of the man upon the box was indeed not unlike the
faces of the demons in old paintings. He set his white
teeth hard together, with a low, hissing laugh, as he guided
the horses onward down the long, straight country road.</p>

<p>“Caged at last, my dear Rosamond!” he ejaculated;
“safe in my hands like a snared bird! It will go hard
with me if I do not handle the Arleigh fortune before
many weeks are over. Ah! what is that?” he exclaimed
as the carriage jolted over the gnarled roots of an immense
oak which had stretched themselves across the
road. And at that moment there fell upon his ears a sudden
sharp sound, a clanging noise, and turning about, he
saw for the first time that the carriage door was wide
open. By the gray light of the early dawn he could see it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
swinging to and fro. It was the sound of the door swinging
against the side of the carriage which had aroused
him to a realization that something was wrong.</p>

<p>“What can it be?” he asked himself, bringing the
horses to a halt with some difficulty, for their spirits were
fully aroused now, and they were eager to go on.</p>

<p>Swiftly, lightly Gilbert Warrington sprung from the
box and rushed wildly around to the door of the vehicle.
It was open, and the bird was flown!</p>

<p>With an outburst of angry oaths which there was no
one to hear, Gilbert Warrington searched the interior of
the carriage. She could not possibly be concealed within,
yet the very thought that she must have made her escape
from the vehicle, tearing along at the mad pace at which
he had been driving, seemed incredible, absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>Having searched carefully, and having satisfied himself
at last that she was not inside the carriage, the discomfitted
villain closed and fastened its door, and then, taking
the reins in his hands, proceeded to lead the horses and
carriage back in the road that he had come. It would be
slow progress, but it was necessary, for he meant to
search every foot of the way back to the spot where he
had so precipitately revealed himself to Rosamond (what
a fool he had been, to be sure!), and even back to The
Oaks, should no trace of the missing woman be discovered.</p>

<p>But all in vain did he seek her; dead or alive, there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
no trace of Rosamond Arleigh to be found. It looked
like magic or witchcraft.</p>

<p>He strode along the road, peering anxiously into every
corner, leading the horses—quite subdued now—and leaving
nothing undone in his anxious search. But all in vain;
he could see nothing, hear nothing that could in any way
furnish a clew to her mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p>He would have believed her dead, that in her escape
from the fast-moving vehicle she had been instantly
killed; but there was no trace of her at all to be found.</p>

<p>Slowly and thoughtfully he led the carriage over the
bridge which spanned the brawling stream where the
poor woman had really made her escape. His
keen eyes fell upon the bank, the steep descent with its
dislodged earth, and the <i>débris</i> which had rolled downward
to the stream below. An exclamation of astonishment,
of surprise and horror, passed his lips. He checked
the horses, and tying them to a tree near by, began a patient
search. Here was the trace of a falling body which
must have rushed with great velocity down to the stream
below.</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington’s eyes wandered to the swift, black
water, and a quick solution of the mysterious disappearance
crossed his mind.</p>

<p>“So!” he muttered sharply between his teeth; “she
has attempted to escape here. There is really no other
place where there is any indication of such a thing having
happened. It is quite likely that she fell down the bank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
to the stream below. And, by Jove!” coming to a sudden
halt as his eyes fell upon a dark object which floated
upon the bosom of the brawling stream, “there is her
cloak now!”</p>

<p>A swift descent; a moment later he held the dripping
garment in his hand.</p>

<p>“It is hers!” he cried. “The poor little fool has undoubtedly
fallen into the water, and is drowned. Well,
since I could not conquer her and make her my wife—or
my slave—to do my will blindly, through fear of me, the
next best thing will be to manage the daughter. I think,
with my hold over Violet (she is a high-strung, honorable
little creature), I may hope to handle the Arleigh fortune
yet. ‘It’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good,’ and I
intend to make the best of existing circumstances. There
is no doubt in my mind (how could any one doubt it?)
that Rosamond is drowned. She has certainly fallen
down the bank to the stream below, and how could it be
possible for her to escape from that cold, black flood in
the gloom and darkness of the night? It is just impossible.
Why, a strong man and a good swimmer would have
great difficulty in getting out of that black flood. I think
there is no doubt that I am safe; I feel sure of it. Her
escape is just impossible.”</p>

<p>Just impossible! Ah, Gilbert Warrington, you forget
that there is One who watches over the helpless and unprotected,
and that “there is nothing impossible with
God.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>At last, tired out by his fruitless search, he crept
slowly and with difficulty up the bank, and in the early
morning, which was just beginning to dawn, he stood once
more beside the carriage with a disappointed look upon his
sullen face.</p>

<p>“Curse her!” he panted, harshly; “that woman has
been the bane of my life. She has led me a fine chase
from first to last. But she is dead now; I am sure of that.
How could she survive such a fall? and the water is very
deep; and I happen to know that she can not swim a
stroke. Well, well! I’ve had a hard night’s work, and
all for nothing. Now I must get back and dispose of the
team and carriage in some way to avert suspicion from
myself.”</p>

<p>He sprung upon the box once more and drove rapidly
away, satisfied that his prisoner must have perished
in the black waters of the stream, yet keeping a sharp
lookout all the time, from his position upon the box, lest
something might have happened to save her from the
fate to which he had mentally consigned her.</p>

<p>But all search was vain. He found nothing; saw no
trace of anything which reminded him of the missing
woman. He drove rapidly back, not to The Oaks, but
to the adjacent village—to Doctor Danton’s house. There
he left the carriage and horses as though they had simply
run away, only to bring up at last at their own stable.
And so indeed Doctor Danton believed when late in the
day, tired and disappointed, chagrined and angry with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
himself and the whole world at large, he returned home
and found the tired and hungry horses, with the carriage
looking none the worse for wear, standing at the open
door of the stable, demurely waiting for some one to attend
to their wants. Tom’s story of the assault upon
him while seated upon the carriage box, patiently awaiting
the coming of his master, was set down to the phantasies
of his own brain overpowered by sleep; and then
he must have fallen from the high box of the carriage
to the ground below, where, striking his head against the
gnarled roots of a huge oak-tree, he had been stunned
and lost consciousness. After which, no doubt, the
horses, finding themselves without a driver, had coolly
run away. This was Doctor Danton’s solution of the
mystery, though that greater mystery, the strange disappearance
of his patient, he could not possibly account
for; yet there was no one to contradict his theory or set
it right. So this was the story that he repeated to Dunbar,
the detective. That gentleman listened in silence,
and his face grew very thoughtful and grave.</p>

<p>“Let me see the carriage,” he said, breaking the pause
of silence which had fallen suddenly upon the close of
the physician’s speech.</p>

<p>Without a word, Doctor Danton led the way to the
stable. It was useless to talk over the matter. To him it
was as plain as possible.</p>

<p>Dunbar made a thorough examination of the interior
of the carriage, while the physician stood quietly by,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
watching him with a slight smile. It all seemed so foolish.</p>

<p>But, at length, with a low cry of triumph, the detective
emerged from the vehicle, where he had been half-hidden,
and held up in one hand before the doctor’s astonished
eyes a small object.</p>

<p>It was a tiny kid slipper.</p>

<p>“See!” he cried, eagerly, his voice trembling with excitement.
“She has been here—inside of the carriage.
That, at least, is proven. For don’t you remember this
slipper, Jack? It is the <i>facsimile</i> of those worn by Mrs.
Arleigh, when she was placed upon the couch in the
drawing-room, supposed to be dead. To make assurance
doubly sure, I will see Miss Violet, and she will identify
it. But I am convinced that Mrs. Arleigh has been in this
carriage. Danton, I ask you in the name of Heaven!
where can she be now?”</p>

<p>Doctor Danton shook his head.</p>

<p>“It is all a mystery to me!” he cried, blankly. “Yet,
surely, there must be some mistake, Dunbar. For how
could she be inside the carriage, and also have driven it
away? Furthermore, I know that Rosamond Arleigh
could not manage a horse, much less two, to save her
life. Clearly, then, there must have been a driver. The
question is: <i>Who was he?</i>”</p>

<div class="chaptitle">DROWNED!</div>


<p>Morning dawned over The Oaks—a fair, smiling April
morning—but the smiles turned into tears long before
noon, and the green face of the earth was drenched with
the downpour from nature’s eyes.</p>

<p>It was really quite fortunate—so Doctor Danton declared
in privacy to Dunbar—for then there would not
be a large attendance at Mrs. Arleigh’s funeral service,
consequently, less questions to parry; and the task would
be easier.</p>

<p>For the physician and the detective had decided, in
solemn conclave, to allow the sham funeral to take place;
to say nothing of the strange and startling events which
had occurred at The Oaks, and allow the whole country-side
to still believe in the fact of Rosamond Arleigh’s
death.</p>

<p>It seemed wrong, almost sacrilegious, to do this; but
the two men believed that they were pursuing the right
course, and had pledged themselves to leave no stone unturned
in their pursuit of Rosamond, and to bring her
would-be murderer to justice. And as long as Violet
was not deceived, there was no real wrong done to anybody.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Early in the morning Mrs. Rutledge entered the drawing-room,
prepared to take a long, last look at her dead
sister; but as she entered the room and her eyes fell upon
the closed coffin, her face grew ghastly white, and she
trembled with anger.</p>

<p>“Doctor Danton,” she exclaimed, coldly, “you are inclined
to be officious. I did not expect to find the coffin
closed. Why, Violet and I, and Hilda also, have been
deprived of a last look at our beloved dead. It is infamous!
I order you to open the coffin at once!”</p>

<p>Doctor Danton had carefully weighed the question
during the long, slow hours which had elapsed since the
strange events of the night. He understood fully the responsibility
that he was undertaking, but still he could
see no other way open. It seemed cruel and unnatural to
conceal the truth from Mrs. Rutledge, Rosamond’s own
and only sister; but then, on the other hand, if she were
told, if the strange news should be broken to her, would
she not insist upon telling Hilda? And Doctor Danton,
in his inmost heart, entertained doubts of Hilda Rutledge
in some way; he did not trust her; and long ago he had
observed Hilda’s jealousy of Violet, and her own ill-concealed
<i>penchant</i> for Leonard Yorke, which Leonard
himself never suspected. So, after conferring with Dunbar,
the physician had decided not to confide in Constance
Rutledge, nor in any one but Violet herself. <i>She</i> must be
told; she must know of her mother’s strange disappearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
and that her fate was even now shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>Doctor Danton looked grave as he listened to Mrs.
Rutledge.</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Rutledge,” he began, deprecatingly,
“I beg you to listen to my explanation. It is but natural,
your desire to view your poor sister’s remains for the last
time; but, my dear madame, you were not prepared for
the consequences of Mrs. Arleigh’s sudden death, and the
change in the weather, which, as you know, has turned
very warm. It was—I grieve to say it—<i>impossible to
keep her</i>.” (“Which I am <i>sure</i>, is perfectly true,” the
doctor added when he afterward repeated the conversation
to Dunbar.)</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is dreadful!” she sobbed. “I—I beg your
pardon, Doctor Danton, for my insolence just now. To
tell the truth, I am half-demented over Rosamond’s sudden
death, and the complications which I fear will follow.”</p>

<p>Doctor Danton bowed coldly.</p>

<p>“She is thinking only of herself and Hilda,” he said
to himself. “She is alarmed for fear they will be set
adrift. I will see that they remain for the present, and
I have hopes of finding Rosamond yet.”</p>

<p>But aloud he said:</p>

<p>“Everything that can be done has been done, I assure
you. We have closed the coffin for obvious reasons, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
placed disinfectants in the room. This sudden change
of weather is very trying in a case like this.”</p>

<p>He turned aside with an air of resignation.</p>

<p>“Where is Miss Violet?” he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>“She is still in her own room. I dread to break it
to the poor child that she will never see her mother again—never,
never!” with an outburst of sobs.</p>

<p>“There is always hope of future meeting, my dear
Mrs. Rutledge,” interposed the doctor, beginning to secretly
enjoy the situation, though despising himself for
the part that he was forced to play.</p>

<p>And did he not have hope of a future, ay, a speedy
meeting, when Rosamond should be found; for he never
for a moment doubted that she would be found. Perhaps
even now she might be at Yorke Towers, for Leonard
had not yet made his appearance at The Oaks. But
on this point Doctor Danton was soon undeceived. A
little later a servant came riding hastily from Yorke
Towers bearing a letter from Leonard Yorke to Mrs. Rutledge,
stating that his mother was so very and alarmingly
ill that he feared within himself now Miss Glyndon
would be able to attend the funeral services. It was an
affectionate letter, despite its brevity, and Leonard had
sent a tender message to Violet, of which the poor girl
never heard. Instead, Hilda informed her later in the
day that Leonard Yorke had written to her mother, and
had inquired particularly for herself. “And quite as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
though he was very anxious about me!” the young lady
added, with a swift glance into Violet’s pale face.</p>

<p>Doctor Danton, reading Leonard’s letter, read between
the lines, and felt certain that the young man was in
trouble.</p>

<p>“As soon as I get through with this awful farce of a
funeral, I will ride over to Yorke Towers,” he decided.</p>

<p>Dunbar had disappeared at break of day. The first
thing that he did was to order his horse saddled, and
once on its back, he rode around to the rear entrance of
The Oaks, to the spot where Doctor Danton had left his
carriage waiting under the control of Tom. Here was
the mark of the wheels where the carriage had stood; over
yonder was the spot where poor Tom had fallen, struck
down by Satan himself, as the poor fellow declared. And
see! there is a beaten space just before a clump of blackberry
bushes, broken as though some one had been standing
there trampling the young grass with impatient feet.</p>

<p>Instinctively, like the sleuth-hound that he was, Dunbar
peered into the bushes, and the first object upon which
his sharp eyes rested was a key. He uttered an exclamation
of surprise at sight of it.</p>

<p>“I believe it is the key to the gate!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Then he picked it up and fitted it into the lock of the
gate.</p>

<p>The key was the first thing that Doctor Danton had
missed—the first cause for suspicion that something was
wrong. So it was correct—this suspicion. Some one had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
locked the gate and thrown the key into the bushes, for
the purpose, no doubt, of retarding the search for the
carriage and its probable occupant.</p>

<p>The detective’s eyes lighted up with an eager light.
Had he struck the right trail? Was he on the road to success?
He did not dream of the obstacles which were destined
to loom up in his way as the hours went by; but,
like a true detective, he welcomed all such obstacles for
the simple pleasure of overcoming them.</p>

<p>“I will follow the tracks of the carriage-wheels,” he
decided. “It is very early, and in this secluded spot no
other vehicle has passed this morning, I feel sure. At all
events, it is the only course left me to pursue.”</p>

<p>He passed his arm through the bridle and led his horse
slowly on, while he searched anxiously down the road,
following the freshly made wheel-tracks.</p>

<p>And so, on, on, he went, slowly and laboriously, mile
after mile. His eyes shone with the light of hope.</p>

<p>“It is plain that Doctor Danton’s carriage did not go
home until it had first taken a trip somewhere,” he concluded,
astutely. “The more I think of it, the plainer
does it appear that somebody drove it away. Those
horses never ran away, in the living world!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>On, on, he went; and so, at last, he reached the stream
and the little bridge. It was very early, the road unfrequented,
no signs of a passer-by. In fact, no one had
passed upon that side of the stream since Gilbert Warrington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
had crossed and had driven Doctor Danton’s
horses home.</p>

<p>All at once Dunbar’s sharp eyes caught a glimpse of the
cloak which Warrington had dropped half-way down the
bank, with its crumbling sand and <i>débris</i>.</p>

<p>At sight of it, Dunbar uttered a wild cry of surprise,
for he recognized the garment at a glance.</p>

<p>“It is the very cloak that Jack Danton had all ready
to wrap Mrs. Arleigh in!” exclaimed the detective. “I
remember well the style of it and the very peculiar buttons.
I could not be deceived in it, and it is the same
cloak; there can be no manner of doubt about that.”</p>

<p>He proceeded to roll the cloak up into a small bundle,
and fastened it to the saddle-bow—a certain proof that
Rosamond Arleigh had been at this spot since midnight
of the night before; then, with swift but careful steps, he
descended the steep bank to the very edge of the water.</p>

<p>“Good God!” he ejaculated, “can she have fallen into
the water; or, worse, can some one have thrown her in, to
get rid of her?” he panted.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he stooped and drew from the wet sand,
imbedded almost out of sight, a little kid slipper, the
mate to the one that he had found in Doctor Danton’s
carriage. Yes; there was no doubt of it.</p>

<p>The detective thrust the little slipper into his coat
pocket, and proceeded to carefully examine the stream.</p>

<p>No trace of anything. Of course, no human creature
could long survive in that black, swirling flood. The current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
was very rapid, and the drift-wood, logs, and <i>débris</i>,
which half-filled the stream, were deadly obstacles, with
which a falling body coming in contact would surely be
deprived of life.</p>

<p>Dunbar’s heart sunk. He was already deeply interested
in the strange case, both for the sake of his friend—and
he had begun to suspect that Jack Danton cared
very much for his interesting patient—and in the interests
of his own profession.</p>

<p>“She has been drowned,” he said, sadly, as he climbed
up the steep bank and went back to where his horse patiently
awaited his coming. “I shrink from breaking
the sad news to Danton; but I must, I suppose. And
poor little Violet! Well, at all events, it is better to
know the worst than to be in suspense.”</p>

<p>Then he mounted his horse and galloped away in the
morning sunshine, back to The Oaks, to break the sad
news.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">THE FIRST MOVE.</div>


<p>As soon as possible Doctor Danton broke the intelligence
to Violet of her mother’s strange and mysterious
disappearance.</p>

<p>The poor girl listened to the story with a heart crushed
and aching. She had hoped so much when she had discovered
that her mother was still living; and now, to find
that her fate was shrouded in awful mystery, seemed
more than she could bear.</p>

<p>Doctor Danton had concluded that it would be best
to tell Violet all, to keep nothing back. So he told her
of the detective’s discovery, and the slippers were at once
identified by her as belonging to her mother.</p>

<p>Had Violet Arleigh told her kind friend, the doctor, of
all that had taken place between Gilbert Warrington and
herself, and the promise which the villain had exacted
from her, everything would have been different, and my
story need not be written; but she feared Warrington with
a deadly terror which sealed her lips and held her tongue
silent. That Gilbert Warrington had kidnapped her
mother, Violet did not for a moment doubt; and her heart
shrunk at thought of what had taken place. She could
see it all in her mind. Gilbert Warrington had driven the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
carriage away with her mother inside; when they had
reached the stream, Rosamond had leaped from the vehicle,
and had, no doubt, met her death in the swift,
black current below. It would be useless to drag the
stream in search of the body, for Violet knew that the
bed of the stream was full of deep holes hidden under
the fallen logs and drift-wood which had lodged there;
and there was a tradition in the country-side that once
drawn down by the resistless current into those yawning
pits there was no hope for any living creature. So Violet
gave up all hope. Her mother was dead; there could be
no doubt upon that point, and as such she mourned her;
and therefore her grief at the funeral was heartfelt and
spontaneous, even though she was well aware that her
mother’s body was not in the closed casket covered with
flowers which stood in the center of the drawing-room.
She only wished that it were true; since God had taken
her mother from her, she felt that it would be a sad consolation
to follow the dear remains to their last resting-place
in the pretty, old-fashioned grave-yard not far from
The Oaks.</p>

<p>The funeral was over, and the household settled down
into mournful quiet once more. Mrs. Rutledge felt
greatly relieved as to her own future, for she had secretly
feared a breaking up of everything at The Oaks; but the
old lawyer who had been Mrs. Arleigh’s adviser since her
husband’s death relieved the lady’s mind by informing her
that for the present all would go on as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Violet said nothing; she was bound to silence; but her
heart sunk in secret as she realized how uncertain was
her own hold upon her childhood’s home; for well she
knew that Gilbert Warrington held her in his power.</p>

<p>The day after the funeral, Leonard Yorke called at
The Oaks, accompanied by Jessie Glyndon. She looked
pale and sad; but that was no wonder, and created no
comment. She had liked Mrs. Arleigh very much, and
then Mrs. Yorke was still very ill, and that alone was
sufficient to affect Miss Glyndon and make her pale and
sad; and no one for a moment connected her sadness with
dark-eyed Will Venners down in New Orleans.</p>

<p>When Leonard and Violet met there was a strange constraint
between them. <i>She</i> thought that, perhaps, his
call had been intended solely for Hilda; and <i>he</i> thought
of that unfortunate poem until his heart grew hard and
bitter. Ever before his mind there floated, in letters of
fire, the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And I said, ‘Love’s soul is not in fetters;</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Neither time nor space can keep souls apart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">If I can not, dare not, send my letters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Through the silence I will send my heart.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so, the foolish fellow, half-wild with jealousy,
treated Violet with cool reserve.</p>

<p>He could not return Will Venners’ poem to Violet, as
he fully intended doing at the first opportunity; for at a
time like this, just after her mother’s death, and Violet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
looking so pale and sad in her black dress, how could he
intrude such a matter upon her notice?</p>

<p>So the poem remained untouched in his vest-pocket,
where it seemed to burn into his very heart; while Violet,
absorbed with her grief and her dark fears of the future
before her, never thought of the poem at all.</p>

<p>But Leonard’s strange coldness cut her to the heart
and nearly broke it. She felt actually relieved when at
last the callers took their departure. She stood at the
drawing-room window watching the pair ride away on
horseback together, with a feeling of relief in her heart
which was new to it.</p>

<p>But she was not suffered to remain long in peace, for
just then a servant appeared at the door of the drawing-room,
and announced:</p>

<p>“<i>Mr. Gilbert Warrington!</i>”</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">GILBERT WARRINGTON’S PLOT.</div>


<p>Gilbert Warrington!</p>

<p>For a moment Violet’s heart stood still, then began
to beat eighteen to the dozen. She pressed her cold,
shaking hand upon it, as though with a hope of quieting
its tumult; then, pale and outwardly calm, she turned and
faced her unwelcome visitor. His sallow face was full of
ill-concealed triumph; his thin lips wore a mocking smile.
He stepped forward and extended his hand, but Violet
drew back with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear Miss Arleigh!”—his voice had an unpleasant
ring to it—“so you refuse to take my hand?
Well, all right. That is just as you see fit. My word for
it, you will be glad to accept any overtures of friendliness
that I may see fit to make you before many days have
passed.”</p>

<p>Violet’s eyes flashed. It was with difficulty that she restrained
her anger; but she confronted him in outward
quiet.</p>

<p>“What is your business with me?” she inquired, in a
low, scornful tone. “Be good enough to state it, and
then leave me. I wish to be alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>He smiled, and his keen eyes shone with a dangerous
glitter.</p>

<p>“Ah, you do?” he sneered. “Well, you shall be alone
in good time, but at present I have something to say to
you, and you must listen to me.”</p>

<p>“Must I?”</p>

<p>Violet’s temper began to gain the ascendency. What
right had this man to come to her in her own home and
command her to listen to <i>him</i>?</p>

<p>“You are inclined to be impudent, Mr. Warrington,”
she added, sharply.</p>

<p>“Not at all.” He drew a little nearer. “See here,
Violet, why can’t you and I be friends? I prefer it so,
and really you will find it much more pleasant since we
are compelled to come in contact with each other.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you. Why am I compelled to
associate with <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>To save her life, Violet could not repress the contempt
in her voice as she spoke the personal pronoun. Gilbert
Warrington’s face flushed for a moment.</p>

<p>“You do not understand me. I have not yet explained
to you,” he returned. “Miss Violet Arleigh, you are
aware that for years I have transacted business with your
mother—the late Mrs. Rosamond Arleigh? You, of
course, knew nothing of the nature of that business, as
it was of a wholly private nature; in short, a secret, a bad,
black secret between Mrs. Arleigh and myself.”</p>

<p>“If so”—Violet’s voice was cold and scornful—“it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
was not <i>her</i> secret. She was never guilty of wrong-doing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well! possibly not. But have you never heard,
my dear young friend, of a person being so hedged in by
circumstances that they have been forced to suffer for the
mistake or wrong-doing of another? Suppose now—just
let us suppose the case—that your father, the late Harold
Arleigh, had been guilty of a sin or crime, and that its
consequences had recoiled upon the head of your innocent
mother, would not she be compelled to suffer from
his wrong-doing, yet be herself perfectly guiltless?”</p>

<p>“You are speaking in riddles,” returned Violet, coldly.
“I do not understand you, sir. Be good enough to explain.
I am certain that Harold Arleigh, my father, was
not a criminal. He would never have committed a crime,
and then allow my poor mother to suffer the consequences—to
be driven to her death, and hounded down to her
grave by a man like you!”</p>

<p>An angry scowl disfigured the sallow face of Warrington.
He clinched his hands involuntarily, as though he
longed to strike the girl down at his feet.</p>

<p>Violet drew back and faced him with flashing, indignant
eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, sir”—in a low, level voice—“I demand that
you make a full explanation. I wish to know exactly
what you mean. I am tired of your hints and insinuations.
I <i>will</i> know what sin my father committed and left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
the shame and suffering for my mother to bear. Thank
Heaven, she has escaped its burden—and <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>“Have a care, Miss Violet Arleigh!” he hissed, vengefully.
“I advise you to be careful, and weigh well what
you are saying. You may get into serious trouble. I am
not the sort of man to stand idly by and allow a woman
to insinuate all sorts of crimes against my good name.”</p>

<p>“Your good name!”</p>

<p>Violet said no more, but the silence which followed was
significant.</p>

<p>“No, Gilbert Warrington,” the girl’s cold voice broke
in upon the pause which followed, “you are not that sort
of man! You are capable of waging war against weakness,
of leading a crusade against friendless and unprotected
women and children. There is no bravery or real
courage about you. From the crown of your head to the
soles of your feet you are an unmitigated coward!”</p>

<p>“By Heaven!”</p>

<p>He sprung to her side and laid his hand heavily upon
her arm. But she shook off his grasp and faced him
bravely, her small head uplifted in conscious pride, her
beautiful dark eyes shining like stars.</p>

<p>“Dare to touch me again!” she panted, breathlessly.
“Dare to lay your hand upon me, Gilbert Warrington,
and I will have you punished as you deserve.”</p>

<p>“Who will make the attempt? Who will venture to
make such an attempt, pray?” he sneered. “Your fine
gentleman lover, Leonard Yorke? Mr. Leonard Yorke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
of Yorke Towers, who makes fierce love to you one hour,
and in the next is pouring forth his very heart at the
dainty feet of your pretty cousin, Hilda Rutledge? Why,
it is common talk throughout the neighborhood that Leonard
Yorke is playing fast and loose with you, and really
does not know which is the most charming, you or Hilda.
They hint, however, that while he is dead in love with
Miss Rutledge, who is poor, he still keeps his hold upon
you, the supposed heiress to the Arleigh fortune.”</p>

<p>She caught the tone of ill-concealed derision in his
voice, and her heart sunk low in her breast with a sharp
pang.</p>

<p>“The ‘supposed heiress’?” she repeated, eagerly.
“Will you kindly explain your object in using the term
‘supposed,’ Mr. Warrington?”</p>

<p>His eyes glittered with a fiendish light.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you have come down to business at last?” he
sneered. “To be sure, I will explain with pleasure. My
dear Miss Arleigh, you must know that I hold in my possession
a secret—a family secret of the Arleighs—which,
if it were made public, would ruin you forever in the
eyes of society and the world in general. Once known
by the world of society, and it will blight and destroy your
happiness; it will make you a very outcast, a pariah among
men. Leonard Yorke will turn coldly from you, and his
love will die.”</p>

<p>“If his love is worth no more than that,” intervened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
Violet, hotly, “it will be better for it to die. But I
thought you said that he loved Hilda?”</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington bit his lip. In his eagerness to
wound and pique Violet, he had forgotten his own words
of a few moments previous.</p>

<p>He smiled coldly.</p>

<p>“Well, I do not care; he will drop you as he would a
scorpion, when he learns the truth concerning you, and
the disgraceful secret for which Harold Arleigh is responsible.”</p>

<p>Violet made no reply; she stood like one stunned, as
gradually the truth, the bitter truth, crept into her heart.
She was in the power of this villain. How, in Heaven’s
name, could she escape? There must be some way of escape,
some road out of the dilemma, but she knew not
which way to turn. Gilbert Warrington seemed to read
her very thoughts.</p>

<p>“Every man has his price, I have been told,” he observed,
sententiously. “<i>I</i> have mine. Are you willing
to pay a price for keeping your unpleasant secret, Miss
Arleigh? Tell me, are you?”</p>

<p>She caught her breath with a suppressed cry.</p>

<p>“What is your price?” she asked, coldly.</p>

<p>Yet no hint of what was coming had as yet intruded
upon her heart. She believed that he would ask a share
of the Arleigh fortune, perhaps. Well, better that than
to be haunted by this bad secret, this ghost of the past;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and to escape from the clutches of this man Warrington
she would sacrifice all that she possessed in the world.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“My price? Oh, yes! Well, Miss Violet Arleigh, it is
this.” His eyes transfixed hers with their steady gaze,
and his thin lips set themselves into a straight, narrow line.
“I know all about this secret, the Arleigh secret,” he went
on, slowly. “I am the only person living, now that your
mother is gone, who does know it. It is a secret which
would ruin you forever if it became known, or even suspected.
But I will promise, will swear, will bind myself
in any way you like, to keep it a dead secret forever, upon
one condition. It is this, that you consent to be my wife.
Once my wife, our interests will be identical, and I will
shield you from all the world, from all harm. I will hide
this secret, and no one will ever suspect its existence. I
will place in your hands the <i>proof</i>, so that you may destroy
it. You shall live a life of ease and luxury. Only
consent to be my wife. Will you, Violet?”</p>

<p>Violet recoiled with a cry of horror; she could not
speak; the very thought was enough to make her heart
sink with a feeling of sickening aversion.</p>

<p>“You are mad!” she panted at last, when she could
find words. “This is an insult, and I will have you punished
for it!”</p>

<p>A smile stole over Gilbert Warrington’s thin lips.</p>

<p>“Do not imagine for one moment that I <i>care</i> for you,”
he said, harshly. “I have never loved any woman in all
my life save your mother, and she scorned me. Listen,
Violet, while I tell you my story in as few words as possible.
Years ago, when I first met your mother, she and
Harold Arleigh were living as happily as ideal lovers, just
for all the world like romances one reads in old books.
It was not the fashion then to debate the question, ‘Is
marriage a failure?’ and Harold and Rosamond never
once thought of such a thing. Their lives were perfectly
happy. Then it was that <i>I</i> came to Yorke Towers; they
lived there at the time. You know that the place was
known then only as The Towers; but when the Yorkes
came into possession they rechristened it Yorke Towers,
and so it has remained ever since. Well, I was the overseer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
on the plantation—not a very elevated position, you
will say; but I was treated with great kindness by both
your father and mother—too kind was she, in fact, for I
soon awoke to the knowledge that <i>I loved her</i>!”</p>

<p>“Loved her? And she a married woman?”</p>

<p>Violet’s voice was full of surprise, not unmixed with
scorn.</p>

<p>A strange expression flashed into Warrington’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, Violet, you need not look so horrified. I learned
to love Rosamond Arleigh before I was aware of it, and
when it was too late I awoke to the truth, and then I
could not crush out the affection from my heart. It has
lived and flourished ever since. But she is gone, and I can
never hope to win her heart.”</p>

<p>“You would never have won her had she lived!” cried
Violet, scornfully.</p>

<p>Warrington smiled a meaning smile.</p>

<p>“We will not discuss that question now, my dear,” he
said, softly. “The business in hand is this: There is
something connected with the past—with your mother’s
past—which, if it were known, would ruin you. Nobody
knows this secret but myself. I swear to keep it a secret
forever, on the condition already named—that you
consent to marry me and share the Arleigh fortune with
‘yours truly.’”</p>

<p>“I will die first!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Very well. But you will never marry Leonard
Yorke, all the same, my dear; and you will be sorry, I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
sure, to have your dead mother’s name upon the lips of
everybody, coupled with dishonor.”</p>

<p>“<i>Dishonor?</i> My mother? You villain!”</p>

<p>Violet moved swiftly over to the door and threw it
open.</p>

<p>“Go!” she panted, in a low, tense tone, her voice full
of dangerous meaning, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>He stood staring into her pale face for a moment, then
drew a little nearer her, and his voice was low and ominous
as he hissed, vengefully:</p>

<p>“I will prove it to you, Miss Violet Arleigh!” he cried.
“Rosamond Arleigh was a base woman—a——”</p>

<p>But Violet, unable to bear any more, stepped quickly
past him through the open door, and hastening down
the hall, left the house without a word. Her heart was
beating tumultuously, her eyes shone with a wild light,
her breath was coming thick and fast.</p>

<p>On, on, she went, like a mad creature, down the long
walk which led to the entrance to The Oaks. A turn
to the right, and there, at the foot of a huge magnolia-tree,
she saw Leonard Yorke. He arose from his seat
upon a rustic bench, and, pale and agitated, came to
meet her.</p>

<p>“Violet! Good heavens! what is the matter?” he
cried. “Oh, my darling, you are ill and in trouble!
What has hurt you? Tell me all, Violet, for I would lay
down my life for you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>She sunk upon the seat which he had just vacated, and
pressed her hand to her throbbing heart.</p>

<p>“I—I thought you were gone long ago,” she faltered,
at last.</p>

<p>“We started for home together, Miss Glyndon and
I,” he returned; “but we met Captain Venners” (a
frown darkened his handsome face as he spoke the
name); “he has just run over from New Orleans, upon
business, he says. The moment Miss Glyndon saw him
she grew pale as death. Somehow, I believe she hates
him. She just bowed to Venners, and then excusing
herself to me, saying that she must go home to mother,
who is very ill, she galloped off as though for dear life,
leaving me with Venners. But he did not linger long.
Violet, do you like Will Venners?”</p>

<p>Violet’s face flushed beneath Leonard’s strange searching
gaze. She had just recollected the poem which Will
had intrusted to her, and which she had failed to deliver.
It was the memory of her own delinquency which
made her look confused; but how was Leonard to know
that?</p>

<p>“Like him?” she repeated; “why, of course I do.
Everybody does, I think. He is so gentle and kind and
thoughtful for everybody, and he is so handsome and
talented, and——”</p>

<p>“There, that is enough!” interposed Leonard, bitterly.
“Quite a piece of perfection, to be sure. But
don’t forget to supplement his perfections with the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
that he is an outrageous flirt—a trifler—a man who
thinks only of his handsome face and graceful figure,
and cares nothing for the hearts he breaks in his mad
career.”</p>

<p>“I think you are hard on poor Will,” observed Violet,
shyly.</p>

<p>But jealousy had the upper hand with Leonard Yorke
now, and nothing could stop him or check his mad heart
and jealous hatred.</p>

<p>“Hard on poor Will, indeed!” he repeated, wrathfully.
“How much you must care for him to champion
him as you do.”</p>

<p>“Care for him! I? Oh, no; only as a friend; but
that, of course, you know, Leonard, after—after what
passed between you and me on my birthday.”</p>

<p>Her shy eyes drooped, and the sweet face flushed
faintly as she recalled his loving words, his fond vows.
Yet here he stood before her, pale with anger, his dark
eyes flashing, the very picture of an angry man, and not
at all like a lover—her own true lover, Leonard. Her
eyes wore a look of wondering surprise. She said to
herself that he had ceased to care for her; that he loved
Hilda instead (perhaps, indeed, he had never cared for
Violet), and then a wave of passionate anger surged over
the girl’s heart, and made it bitter and sore.</p>

<p>“Well, if he regrets the past, and wishes to recall his
vows, he must suit himself,” she exclaimed under her
breath, her heart hot with a jealous anger. She rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
slowly and turned away. “I must go back to the house,”
she observed, though her heart sunk at the thought of
possibly encountering Gilbert Warrington there.</p>

<p>She hesitated, and a keen pang of regret struck to her
heart like a knife.</p>

<p>Could she leave Leonard thus? Could she bear it that
he should be angry with her without a cause? She ventured
to lay her hand upon his.</p>

<p>“Leonard!”</p>

<p>He turned, and his eyes rested upon her face, pale,
sad, and troubled exceedingly. He pressed the little
hand to his lips.</p>

<p>“Violet! Violet!” he cried, “why do you torture me
so? Surely you are not deceitful, and——”</p>

<p>“Torture you!” she interrupted, in a clear, ringing
voice. “Deceitful! And I used to think that you
loved me!”</p>

<p>“Loved you! My God——”</p>

<p>But the words died upon Leonard’s lips; the hand
that held Violet’s dropped to his side. He stared before
him, pale and calm, and outwardly indifferent. For at
that moment, just around a curve in the adjacent shrubbery,
Hilda appeared. She looked like a picture in her
long, clinging black princess gown, which revealed every
outline of her graceful figure.</p>

<p>She looked pensive and thoughtful, too; but as she
drew nearer the pair beneath the magnolia-tree, she
lifted her eyes. Her face flushed, and then grew pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“Why, Leonard,” she cried, in affected surprise, coming
to a halt before the two, “I thought that you had
gone—oh, ages ago!”</p>

<p>Leonard forced a smile.</p>

<p>“I had only reached the gate when Miss Glyndon and
I met Captain Venners. He had just arrived from New
Orleans—came home upon some business of importance,
he said. He stopped his horse long enough to speak with
Miss Glyndon and myself, then rode on. But Miss Glyndon
has gone home to Yorke Towers,” he added, swiftly,
“and I was feeling a little blue and ‘off,’ and so I concluded
to sit down here under this grand old magnolia-tree
to—to smoke. And then, after I had finished my
cigar, I saw Violet coming, and we remained here talking
for a few moments.”</p>

<p>Hilda’s great dark eyes were fixed upon his face, as
though striving to read its every expression. It struck
to poor Violet’s heart like a blow that he had taken great
pains to prepare an elaborate explanation to satisfy fair
Hilda.</p>

<p>“Violet,” she said, abruptly, “<i>I</i> saw Captain Venners
just now for a moment. He asked me to say to you that
he would call upon you this evening.” Then, laying her
hand upon Leonard’s arm, she added, softly: “Come,
Leonard; I want you to look at my bed of Mexican
Torranias. They are just lovely!”</p>

<p>And as though powerless to resist her, Leonard allowed
her to lead him away, and Violet was left alone.</p>

<div class="chaptitle">ALIVE!</div>


<p>When Rosamond Arleigh struck the water in her mad
descent down the steep sandy bank, she gave herself up
for lost.</p>

<p>The cold, dark water closed swiftly over her, and she
sunk for a moment out of sight; then she rose to the
surface, and with numbed hands clutched wildly at the
nearest object, even as the drowning man will clutch at
a straw. Her hands came in contact with a huge pine log.
She grasped its rough bark; her hands slipped, and she
fell once more.</p>

<p>She had lost her slippers—one was in the carriage, the
other imbedded in the wet sand near the edge of the
stream. Her cloak had slipped from her shoulders;
she was utterly unprotected from the cold water, and a
chill struck to her very heart.</p>

<p>It was intensely dark. She could not see which way
the carriage had gone; but it <i>had</i> gone, and that was
enough to revive a feeble hope within her heart.</p>

<p>If only Gilbert Warrington would not miss her until
he was so far away that she might have time and a chance
to escape, then indeed there was hope. But how <i>could</i>
she escape?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>It was dark and cold; the stream was deep and
treacherous, and the current swift and strong. Besides,
the logs and <i>débris</i> in the water choked up its course, and
it was positively dangerous for an expert swimmer to
attempt to make his way through the swift, dark tide,
at that hour.</p>

<p>It all flashed through her bewildered brain with the
rapidity with which thought flashes at such a time, when
one is upon the verge of drowning. She tried hard to
grasp the situation, but her brain was weak and numb
from the strange experience through which she had
passed, and she could not collect her thoughts, nor do
anything to help herself; only, with a vague impulse
of self-preservation, the first law of nature, she struck
out blindly, with a faint hope of reaching shore.</p>

<p>Clutching at the tall, tough grass and native shrubs
which grew near, she might have eventually succeeded,
for she was desperate; but all at once, with a rush and
a roar and a plunge down the stream, a small raft of
cypress logs fastened together came tearing madly, under
the direction of a stout negro in a small boat, who
evidently superintended the raft.</p>

<p>On came the logs, and poor Rosamond, directly in
their way, was utterly powerless to escape, while the
negro in the boat could not possibly see what was ahead
of him; and, of course, he would not be on the lookout
for such a phenomenon as a woman struggling in the
cold, dark water alone at that unearthly hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>Somehow it flashed across Rosamond’s understanding;
she realized her awful danger. She half arose in the
water and shrieked aloud at the top of her voice:</p>

<p>“<i>Help! help!</i>”</p>

<p>On rushed the logs! The negro in the boat, half convinced
that he had seen a ghost in that one swift glimpse
of a death-white face and long, dark, streaming hair,
which for a brief space confronted him, paused in the act
of rowing, and uttered an imprecation.</p>

<p>“Gor a’mighty! what dat?” he exclaimed. “‘Pears
like thar’s a woman—a white woman—or a <i>ha’nt</i>! Don’t
jis’ know which a one, but ’twas one or t’odder, <i>sho’</i>!”</p>

<p>He guided his boat dexterously around the side of the
small raft, but not in time to avert the threatened calamity,
for with a mad rush the logs dashed onward,
striking poor Rosamond full in the head with a blow
which might have felled an ox. Without a cry or a
moan, she sunk swiftly out of sight, and all was still.</p>

<p>The negro, trembling like a leaf, had witnessed the
catastrophe, just a moment too late. He fastened his
boat to the raft and sprung into the water.</p>

<p>“I isn’t gwine ter sit here and see no woman
drowned,” he muttered as he dived beneath the surface.</p>

<p>A moment later; then the water was agitated, and
once more the negro arose on the dark bosom of the
water, grasping in his arms the unconscious form of
Rosamond Arleigh.</p>

<p>With some difficulty he succeeded in placing her in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
the bottom of his boat, and getting in himself, began to
pull for dear life, but not to the shore that she had left.
He was afraid of being punished for allowing the lady
to drown, and he firmly believed that she was dead.</p>

<p>He made up his mind in a moment. He would go on
to New Orleans. There were no more obstacles now in
the way of his raft, which would glide swiftly on into
the lake, to be towed over by some schooner. He determined,
therefore, to convey the body to New Orleans,
and have it buried by the authorities. Perhaps it could be
managed so that no questions would be asked, and he
would not be punished for his carelessness.</p>

<p>He rowed onward with all his might, until the veins in
his arms stood out like whip-cords and the perspiration
trickled in a steady stream down his ebony face.</p>

<p>It occurred to him all at once that even when the lake
would be reached, it would be difficult to persuade a
schooner captain to convey the dead body to the city.
Perhaps it would be better to bury it in the sand at the
mouth of the stream, and no one would be the wiser.</p>

<p>But the first faint gleams of morning sunrise showed
an unexpected sight. The woman was still alive!</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">NO HOPE.</div>


<p>Alive! Could it be possible?</p>

<p>The negro uttered an exclamation, half terror, half
surprise.</p>

<p>“Lawd ha’ marcy!” he ejaculated, scratching his
woolly head in blank perplexity. “Dat ’ar ’ooman sho’ly
is a quare ’un! Done got a lick side de head ’nuff to
knock over a mule! So ’pears to me,” reflectively; “but
den some folks kin stand a heap.”</p>

<p>Now it happened that the force of the blow was greatly
exaggerated in appearance; at all events, Rosamond had
made a wonderful escape; for the logs had rushed violently
down the swirling stream just as she had turned
aside in her mad scramble for the shore, and had dipped
beneath the water like a sea-bird, coming up just in time
to receive a blow upon the head, but not the brunt of the
collision.</p>

<p>It was bad enough, however, and the negro was certainly
not to be wondered at for looking upon her as a
dead woman.</p>

<p>But now her eyes were open and staring wildly before
her.</p>

<p>The man stooped and peered into the white face, removing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
his hat with the natural deference of his race for
the white woman.</p>

<p>“Good-mawnin’, lady!” he cried, eagerly. To tell the
truth, he felt wonderfully relieved to discover that she
still lived. “Is you much hurt?”</p>

<p>But there was no answer. The great dark eyes stared
blankly into the kindly black face, but there was no gleam
of intelligence in their depths. They seemed utterly devoid
of expression, and to all appearance sightless, as they
stared up into the good-natured countenance of the black
man.</p>

<p>He felt a strange sensation of terror quite new to him.</p>

<p>“Kin I do anythin’ for ye, missis?” he persisted.</p>

<p>But still there was no answer, no sign or motion. She
lay as still as a graven image, and there was no sign of
life.</p>

<p>But the man was relieved. She was living, and therefore,
he was guiltless of having caused her death. But
what could he do for her?</p>

<p>“I’se gwine git her over to New Orleans,” he muttered
at length, decisively; “den I gwine git her inter de
hospital.”</p>

<p>On, on, went the little boat. The still, rigid form of the
woman lay motionless. Not even her eyelids quivered
nor a muscle contracted. And so, at last, just about noon—at
nearly the same hour when Rosamond Arleigh’s
funeral services were concluded, and the coffin hidden
away under the red earth piled high in the old grave-yard—poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Rosamond reached the schooner, was placed on
board, and the trip to the city begun.</p>

<p>The negro, whose name was Clark, informed the captain
of the vessel that the lady had met with an accident;
and he begged so hard that the poor creature might be
allowed to make the trip upon his schooner, that the captain
had not the heart to refuse.</p>

<p>The schooner reached the city the next morning. A
little later, the kind-hearted captain had made arrangements
for the reception of Rosamond Arleigh at the
charity hospital.</p>

<p>She lay upon her white bed in the accident ward, and
two of the most learned physicians in the city bent over
the silent form. A long and careful examination disclosed
the fact that the skull had been fractured, and a
bit of bone had been forced upon the brain. The physicians
looked at each other.</p>

<p>Doctor Dane shook his head. He was the younger
and less experienced of the two.</p>

<p>“She will die,” he said, slowly, “or——”</p>

<p>“Or she will live, but with a shattered intellect,” interposed
Doctor Bruce, quickly. “Perhaps it would be kinder
to let her die, for the alternative is horrible. But one must
do the humane in such a case. One can not stand idly
by and see a human creature perish, when even one frail
chance remains.”</p>

<p>“Then you think that there may be a chance?” inquired
the other physician, softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Doctor Bruce nodded.</p>

<p>“There may be; but it is a frail one, and attended with
great difficulty and danger. You forget, Dane, that if the
fractured skull, or the bit of bone which presses upon the
brain itself should be lifted, and the brain relieved from
the pressure, the probability is that the patient will be
restored to her right mind. On the other hand, the prospect
is that she will go down to her grave a hopeless idiot.
Fine-looking woman, isn’t she? And the entire case is
shrouded in mystery. Captain Cloyne, of the schooner
<i>Reine</i>, brought her here this morning, with a brief explanation
that she had been placed in his care by a negro
who had rescued the woman from drowning in one of
the small rivers tributary to the lake. Cloyne is really to
blame for not finding out the particulars; but he looked
overjoyed to get her off his hands, and really no one can
wonder at it; so I was obliged to accept his meager explanation.
Well, Dane, what do you say, my boy? Shall
we attempt the remedy? It is all that I can prescribe; and
in her case she is very frail and delicate evidently. I
doubt if she can endure the operation. And I dare not
administer chloroform or anything of the sort, for, if I
mistake not, she has been suffering from a severe affection
of the heart, and I do not think it safe to administer
such a thing.”</p>

<p>So at length it was decided to make the attempt; but,
after a delicate and tedious operation, the case was resigned
as hopeless, for no good results were apparent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>A tiny portion of the skull still pressed upon the brain.
Small as it was, it was enough to prevent the success of
the operation, and the case was relinquished, reluctantly
enough, by the two physicians as one beyond their skill.</p>

<p>So, after long days and nights of patient nursing, during
which Rosamond slowly recovered her strength, she
was removed to the Louisiana Retreat for the Insane.
The case was entered upon the books in the department
for unknown and mysterious cases; the newspapers published
a brief paragraph; but as no one knew the name of
the stream in which the unknown woman had been found,
neither of the parties concerned in regard to Rosamond
Arleigh’s fate for a moment thought of connecting the
heroine of the newspaper paragraph with Rosamond
Arleigh.</p>

<p>And so the affair died away into silence, and in time it
was no longer discussed.</p>

<p>In her cell at the retreat poor Rosamond sat in stolid
silence day after day, staring out between the bars of
the iron grating which shut out the world beyond. Nothing
interested her; there was no gleam of intelligence
left within her brain. She was a hopeless idiot, perfectly
harmless, but incurable. So the wise physicians had
decided.</p>

<p>The days came and went, and weeks glided into months,
but still she lived on in her dreary, aimless existence,
surely the most pitiful under the sun.</p>

<p>And away at her old home—The Oaks—poor Violet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
was mourning for her mother, whom she felt certain had
perished in the treacherous waters, but whom the world
believed to be lying in her little grave in the old green
cemetery.</p>

<p>Violet felt that it would be better far to <i>know</i> that she
was indeed sleeping in the grave, rather than to feel this
dreadful and secret uncertainty as to her fate.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Dunbar had not been idle. He had
haunted the country-side; passed hours near the bridge
where the cloak and slippers had been discovered; interviewed
every lumberman and laborer engaged in work
near the spot; but all in vain.</p>

<p>It chanced that the negro, Clark, who had befriended
Rosamond, had remained in New Orleans, having procured
employment there; so there was no chance for
Dunbar to encounter him—no way for the truth to become
known.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a strange fatality in regard to the
entire affair. Poor Rosamond seemed destined to be cut
off from all hope and hold on life and the world in which
she no longer played her weary part. She was like one
who is dead, yet is still living.</p>

<p>Dunbar was indefatigable. He was a true detective,
and would follow the slightest clew with dogged persistency,
tracking down the least hint until it dwindled away
into nothing.</p>

<p>Doctor Danton spent money like water in his mad efforts
to find some trace of Rosamond; and between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
two, the truth must surely have come to light, but for
the perverse fate which detained the negro in New Orleans—the
only person capable of setting the detective
upon the track.</p>

<p>It was like “looking for a needle in a bottle of hay,”
so Dunbar declared; but all the same, he had sworn
never to give up the search until every hope, every
chance was exhausted, no matter how faint and feeble it
might be.</p>

<p>But at last the day came when even Dunbar ceased to
hope, and Rosamond’s fate was shrouded in mystery.</p>

<div class="chaptitle">JEALOUSY.</div>


<p>Leonard Yorke rode away from The Oaks with a heart
full of angry resentment. So, Captain Venners was coming
to call upon Violet that evening. Violet was evidently
deeply interested in the handsome, dashing young fellow
who had won the reputation of a flirt, and who was such
an immense favorite with the ladies.</p>

<p>Could he have been deceived in Violet Arleigh? Could
it be that she was not the simple-hearted girl that he had
believed her? She was fond of admiration—too fond;
and, worse than all, to Leonard’s jealous fancy, she was
too fond of handsome, dark-eyed Will Venners.</p>

<p>With a sore heart, he rode away from The Oaks,
angry with Violet and with himself, and detesting Will
Venners with all his heart.</p>

<p>“So he is going to call there this evening!” Leonard
repeated half-angrily to himself, as he turned his horse’s
head toward home. “They will pass a quiet evening together,
and she will never think of me at all, I suppose.
But Violet is my betrothed wife, and I have a right to visit
The Oaks. Why should I not call also?”</p>

<p>The idea seemed feasible and proper. He made up his
mind at length that he would ride over to The Oaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
again that night, at the same time that Captain Venners
would call there.</p>

<p>Leonard rode up the long avenue leading to Yorke
Towers, feeling a little better after he had made up his
mind to this step.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the fine old house he was met by
Miss Glyndon.</p>

<p>“Your mother is asking for you, Mr. Yorke,” she
said, as soon as he entered the house; and there was a
tone of relief in her voice at the sight of him. “She is
better, but she seems to be greatly troubled about something.
Please go right up.”</p>

<p>Leonard Yorke ascended the great staircase, which
wound in a circular form up from the center of the entrance
hall, and a few moments later he rapped at the
door of his mother’s room.</p>

<p>“Come in!” called a faint voice; and Leonard turned
the knob and entered.</p>

<p>The room, a great Gothic chamber, was in semi-darkness;
the windows were draped in crimson hangings; the
furniture was heavy and antique; the walls were hung
with paintings and lined with books. It was a sumptuous
apartment; but the woman who lay upon the bed, drawn
up near an open window, looked as if nothing in the world
could make her happy or contented. Her pale, delicate
face was still quite beautiful. She had not yet passed middle
age, and the soft, dark hair, drawn back from a broad,
low brow, was scarcely touched with silver. Her features<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
were delicate and high-bred, but worn and grave to sadness.</p>

<p>As her eyes—calm gray eyes which, in spite of their
calmness, could flash with bitter anger and indignation—fell
upon the face of her son, she held out her thin white
hand.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, son?” she asked, gently.</p>

<p>His face flushed.</p>

<p>“Over at The Oaks, mother. Poor Violet is nearly
crushed by her mother’s sudden and awful death.”</p>

<p>He hesitated, checking himself at the expression of
suffering which flashed over his mother’s pale face.</p>

<p>“I did not stay long,” he added, swiftly. “I shall call
there again this evening. Mother, I wish you were well
enough to invite Violet and Mrs. Rutledge and Hilda over
here for a time. Violet has never visited Yorke Towers;
she has only called occasionally; and—and——”</p>

<p>His voice stammered into silence at the glance from
his mother’s calm gray eyes. He had not yet broken to
her the news of his engagement to Violet. How was
she going to take it?</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke sighed.</p>

<p>“I fear that I am too ill to entertain anybody,” she
returned, slowly. “Yet,” starting slightly, as though a
sudden thought had struck her, “perhaps it will be better
for me to take your advice. I—I have a reason for—— Son,
I believe upon the whole that I will try and arouse
myself, and I will send the invitation to the ladies at once.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
There is no use in their staying at home nursing their sorrow;
and we are neighbors and old friends, and, of
course, here they will be perfectly at home. There will be
no rules of ceremony to follow, and the change will benefit
them all, I am sure.”</p>

<p>Low under her breath she was saying softly:</p>

<p>“I will get that girl here, and then I will try and find
out if she knows anything of the past, of her mother’s
secret and mine. But I will watch Violet well, for there
must not be anything serious between her and Leonard.”</p>

<p>Aloud she added, gently:</p>

<p>“I believe I will write the invitation now.”</p>

<p>“But, mother dear, you are not able to——”</p>

<p>“I am able to write a few lines, and I am able to sit
up and to get about my room a little. And I want them
to come over here as soon as possible,” she added, her
eyes lighting up, her pale cheeks flushing slightly. “Place
writing materials on my desk, Leonard, and wheel it to
my side. There, that is right!”</p>

<p>She seemed strangely elated and quite excited over the
prospect of the visitors from The Oaks. Leonard could
not understand it. But he silently obeyed her directions,
and in a few moments the note was written, the most
cordial and neighborly note that Mrs. Yorke had ever
written to any one at The Oaks. She laid before Mrs.
Rutledge what a benefit the change would be to herself
and the young ladies, and then it would be a charity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Mrs. Yorke and Miss Glyndon to have them come to
Yorke Towers.</p>

<p>The invitation was received in due time by Mrs. Rutledge,
and promptly accepted without reference to Violet.
This was too good a chance to be lost for Hilda to try and
win Leonard Yorke.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge smiled with a swift, furtive glance in
the direction of her daughter when she read the invitation
aloud. Hilda returned the glance with a significant
nod.</p>

<p>“Strange that you have never visited Yorke Towers,
Violet,” she observed.</p>

<p>Violet smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not at all. There was something unpleasant,
I have always fancied, between Mrs. Yorke and my poor
mother. What it was, I do not know. Aunt Constance,
do <i>you</i> know anything about it? Or, perhaps, I ought not
to ask.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rutledge smiled an acid smile.</p>

<p>“There was something like jealousy between them,
I believe, over Harold Arleigh,” she returned, in an indifferent
tone; “but I do not think it amounted to much;
and, anyway, Rosamond won him, and so she could afford
to be magnanimous. But I must confess, Violet, that
I do not think your mother ever really liked Mrs. Yorke.
I am sure that there was no love lost between them, and
that is why she opposed Leonard’s calling here so often.”</p>

<p>“Opposed Leonard—Mr. Yorke—calling here?” repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Violet, in amazement. “Why, Aunt Constance,
that is the first I ever heard of it. Why—the very last
night that she—the night of my ball, she was speaking to
me of Leonard in the kindest and most affectionate way,
I am sure you are mistaken, auntie; mamma <i>did</i> like
Leonard.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! you need not go into hysterics over it. I
suppose it is so since you say so. But suppose, Violet,
that there was really anything serious between you and
Leonard—(why, you are blushing like a peony)—would
you marry him against your mother’s wishes?”</p>

<p>Silence! Violet shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, I would not marry any man of whom my darling
mother did not approve,” she said, slowly; “but then I
know that mamma <i>did</i> approve of Leonard, for she told
me so.”</p>

<p>“Mamma”—Hilda’s voice broke in upon Violet’s eager
words—“why do you speak of such folly as Leonard
Yorke caring for Violet? You know that he cares for
some one else.”</p>

<p>Violet turned to her cousin, pale and trembling.</p>

<p>“Explain, Hilda!” she said, quickly. “I do not understand
you.”</p>

<p>But Hilda tossed her pretty dark head and laughed derisively.</p>

<p>“Wait!” was all that she would say.</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang, and a servant appeared with a
card for Violet. She glanced at it, and her face flushed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
The name upon the card was Captain Venners. She rose
at once.</p>

<p>“Will you come down, Hilda?” she asked, laying the
card before her cousin.</p>

<p>Hilda glanced at it.</p>

<p>“He has called to see you,” she returned, shortly.
“No, I will not go down. ‘Two are company, and three
a crowd!’ You know the old saying.”</p>

<p>So, feeling a little uncomfortable, Violet went slowly
down to the drawing-room, in her plain black dress with
soft white ruffles at throat and wrists, looking very fair
and mournful.</p>

<p>“A sweet, true little woman!” thought Will Venners,
as he took her little hand in greeting.</p>

<p>“I am <i>so</i> glad to see you, Miss Arleigh!” he began at
once, in his frank, boyish way. “I hope that you are feeling
better. My poor little friend, my heart aches with
sympathy for you in your great loss!”</p>

<p>Her head drooped. The great tears welled up into her
soft dark eyes; her chin quivered; but she controlled her
emotion. She sunk into a seat at her visitor’s side.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Miss Glyndon?” she asked, after a
brief silence.</p>

<p>Will’s bronzed face flushed crimson, then grew pale
and stern.</p>

<p>“I have seen her for a few moments,” he returned,
coldly, “and she—she froze me out, Miss Violet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“I must tell you about the poem,” Violet was beginning,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Poor child! she was half afraid to confess her delinquency
and acknowledge that she had lost his precious
effusion. But, still fated to go on in this odd game of
cross-purposes, Will cut in sharply:</p>

<p>“No matter; I know. There is no need to explain, or,
in fact, to mention it at all. Jessie Glyndon is a flirt—a
coquette. She has never cared for me from first to
last.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Will!”</p>

<p>“It is true—true—true!” he cried, rising to his feet
and beginning to pace up and down the room in mad haste.
“She has proved the truth to me this day. Violet, I believe
that I shall go away from Louisiana—quit the whole
country—cut it all—run over to Texas and turn cowboy
or something. I’m dead tired of civilization as it is found
here. And then, some day, when I hear that Jessie is
married to some one who suits her—some one good
enough and proud enough, and, above all, <i>rich</i> enough
to please Miss Jessie Glyndon—I will come back.”</p>

<p>He paused, quite out of breath, his eyes flashing, his
white teeth gnawing fiercely at the heavy dark mustache
which shaded his handsome upper lip.</p>

<p>“Jessie is not mercenary,” ventured Violet, swift to
speak in her friend’s defense.</p>

<p>“No? Well, I am pleased to hear it; but I must beg
leave to differ with you there. I see it all. I am only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
poor Will Venners, a retired army officer; but I am only
thirty-three, and I have won my shoulder-straps—won
them in good, hard fights on the Colorado plains, facing
the red devils, under Custer. I am proud of my record,
Miss Violet, and I shall be proud of it should a dozen
Miss Glyndons regard me with contempt.”</p>

<p>“She does not—indeed she does not!” cried Violet,
warmly. “How could she?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear little friend! Thank God for your
friendship, since I can not win her love.”</p>

<p>He had her hand in his, and had raised it to his lips,
when just at that moment the door opened and Hilda appeared,
and at her side, pale and wrathful, stood Leonard
Yorke. He had witnessed the scene between Violet
and Will Venners, and, of course, to his jealous nature,
there could be but one inference.</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">AT YORKE TOWERS.</div>


<p>Violet started, and Will dropped her hand as though
it were a live coal, as Leonard entered the room with a
slight greeting, and began at once to converse with Mrs.
Rutledge, who had also put in an appearance. Poor Violet
and Will looked the very pictures of guilty confusion,
and plunged into the first subject at hand for conversation.
Violet felt Leonard’s stern eyes upon her, and her
heart sunk with its weight of sorrow.</p>

<p>“I thought I would ride over this evening,” began
Leonard, a little stiffly, “to make arrangements for bringing
you all over to Yorke Towers to-morrow. I will
send the carriage for Mrs. Rutledge and Miss Hilda.
Violet, you and I might ride. You will like to take your
saddle-horse to Yorke Towers, will you not?”</p>

<p>Violet’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; very much! I have not ridden in some time.
Thank you, Mr. Yorke.”</p>

<p>“But, Violet,” interrupted Hilda, hastily, “Selim has
cast a shoe, so I heard old Andrew say, and he is a little
lame; you can not use him.”</p>

<p>Violet looked disappointed; but before she could venture
a reply, Will Venners arose to take his departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“I shall not return to New Orleans for a day or two,”
he observed; “shall I not have the pleasure of meeting
you ladies again?”</p>

<p>“We shall be pleased to see you at Yorke Towers,”
said Leonard, a little coldly.</p>

<p>Venners bowed.</p>

<p>“Thanks, very much,” he replied. “I may possibly be
able to avail myself of your invitation.” But, as he took
Violet’s hand at parting, he managed to whisper: “I
shall not see you again. Will you write to me—you know
my address—and let me know all about her?”</p>

<p>Violet smiled uneasily; but she answered yes. Leonard
knew that some engagement had been made between
the two, but he was too proud to ask any questions when
Captain Venners was gone.</p>

<p>The remainder of Leonard’s call was exceedingly unsatisfactory
to Violet; but Hilda monopolized him exclusively,
and was the only one who enjoyed the situation.</p>

<p>In the depths of her heart, Violet would have been glad
of an excuse to give up the visit to Yorke Towers; but
she could not well withdraw now. So she listened in
silence to the arrangements made by the others, and
Leonard agreed to call at The Oaks in the morning with
the Yorke carriage.</p>

<p>Morning came fair and bright. The carriage drove up
to the entrance of the house, and Mrs. Rutledge was
assisted within, followed by Violet, and Hilda was left
to share the remaining seat with Leonard, much to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
secret satisfaction; and it was just what she had intended
from the first. They reached Yorke Towers in
the bright morning sunshine, and were ushered to their
respective rooms. A strange oppression settled down
upon Violet’s spirits; she felt gloomy and sad, though
she knew not why. She closed the door of her own
room behind her, and went over to a window which
opened upon an iron balcony, from which a narrow
staircase wound down to the grounds below. It was a
very odd, old-fashioned house, and there were many
strange stories told of it. For instance, there was a
room called the east chamber. Violet had never entered
it, but she had heard the legend connected with it—a
wild tale of love and jealousy.</p>

<p>When Yorke Towers had belonged to the Arleighs, it
was said that the two brothers—Bertram and Wayne—had
both loved the same woman. But Bertram had
won her, and had brought his bride to the Towers to
live. She was young and very beautiful—a golden-haired,
blue-eyed fairy full of life and sunshine. But
she soon found that her husband was a jealous tyrant.
He kept her a virtual prisoner in the gloomy old house,
shut out from all society or the company of her own sex.
Day after day she pined away, and life lost all charm for
her. Then Wayne Arleigh came to the Towers. He
had a right there, for it was the ancestral home of the
Arleighs. He began at once to try and secretly win the
affections of the lovely young wife. He succeeded, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
she gave her heart to the traitorous brother. But all
the time her husband was watching her with eager, jealous
eyes, waiting to convince himself that she was false.
The day came when he was convinced beyond a doubt.
It was a terrible blow to him, but he said nothing; he
only set his teeth together sharply over a muttered oath.</p>

<p>That night he invited his brother to accompany him
into the east chamber, and, quite unsuspicious, Wayne
followed him thither. Once there, Bertram Arleigh
closed the door upon his brother, locking it upon the outside,
and went swiftly away. The room was at the
farthest extremity of the great house; its one window
was secured by an iron grating; no possibility of escape.
And there Wayne Arleigh lingered, dying at last a horrible
death from slow starvation. And the world outside
never knew the truth until upon his death-bed Bertram
Arleigh confessed his awful crime.</p>

<p>Violet recalled the old legend now as she glanced from
her window across the court-yard to the east chamber.
No one ever entered it now. She turned away with a low
sigh, and just then her eyes fell upon a letter lying upon
the toilet-table. She picked it up in wondering surprise.
A sealed letter addressed to herself!</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i15" style="max-width: 28.125em;">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A WARNING.</div>


<p>Violet broke the seal of the letter with a strange misgiving
in her heart. It was written in a plain though
somewhat cramped hand, and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Arleigh</span>—You and yours have been
cruelly wronged. If you would avenge your mother and
gain possession of your own rights, visit the east chamber
at Yorke Towers and search for certain papers which
are said to be concealed there. I can tell you no more
than this. I am your friend, though necessity compels me
to conceal my identity from you. Be on your guard and
act with prudence and caution, and God will help the
friendless orphan.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Your Friend.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Violet read and reread this strange epistle, her heart
full of unpleasant forebodings. It flashed across her
mind then, the strange condition of affairs between her
mother and Mrs. Yorke. There had been polite intercourse
between them as friends and neighbors, but at the
same time, under it all there had been something like distrust,
a certain ill-concealed jealousy. Violet thought of
it all now, and wondered what could be the reason for this
condition of affairs.</p>

<p>She slipped the letter into her pocket, and removing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
her street-dress, donned a pretty black lawn, with a jet
necklace and bracelets. Then she stepped out upon the
balcony and stood gazing around her upon the fair scene
stretched out before her eyes. Off in the distance a gleam
of silver, where the pretty river wound in and out amid
green hills and smiling dales; overhead, a blue sky with a
few fleecy white clouds sailing over its azure bosom; below,
a smooth, green lawn stretching down to the river’s
edge, and dotted with gorgeous flower-beds.</p>

<p>A lovely place was Yorke Towers. No wonder that
Helen Yorke had clung to it and fought for it, and would
almost lay her life down in its defense.</p>

<p>And then Violet’s eyes wandered over to the eastern
portion of the huge old building, to the room where that
awful tragedy had taken place so many years before,
where the mysterious letter had told Violet to search for
the documents referred to.</p>

<p>What papers were they, and why must she search for
them? In vain did Violet turn the question over in her
mind; she could find no answer to it. But a strange feeling
had taken possession of her heart, a feeling for which
she could not account, but which led her to feel that the
letter, no matter from whom it had come, spoke the truth,
and was of real importance to her.</p>

<p>“I will say nothing to any one,” she decided at length;
“but I will watch my opportunity to visit the east chamber;
and once there, I will search it thoroughly. But I
really do not know what I expect to find, and it does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
seem proper to take such liberties with Mrs. Yorke’s
house.”</p>

<p>She felt greatly distressed and troubled over this matter;
but at last she decided to dismiss the subject from
her mind.</p>

<p>She descended the narrow staircase which led from the
balcony out into the grounds, and was soon wandering
through a green and shady arcade with hedges of roses
on either side and the air laden with fragrance.</p>

<p>All at once the sound of suppressed sobbing fell upon
her ears, followed by an outburst of weeping speedily
controlled.</p>

<p>Violet came to a halt, uncertain whether to advance or
retreat; and then she saw, crouching at the foot of a large
tree, a white-robed figure with bowed head—a girl, weeping
bitterly. A second glance, and Violet saw that it was
Jessie Glyndon. It did not seem possible that the proud,
self-possessed Miss Glyndon could be huddled up in that
crumpled heap at the foot of the tree, weeping and sobbing
as though her heart would break. And as Violet
turned to leave the spot, her light footsteps unheard upon
the soft grass, she caught the sound of a name which
Miss Glyndon breathed forth in a tone of heart-break and
despair. That name was “<i>Will</i>!”</p>

<p>Violet felt a swift sensation of surprise. Why, who
would ever have thought that Jessie Glyndon cared
enough for Will Venners to <i>cry</i> about him? So thought
Violet to herself. Yet, after all, it might not be Will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
<i>Venners</i>, for there are hundreds of other Wills in the
world.</p>

<p>Violet stole quietly away, and made her way to the
house once more, and Jessie Glyndon never dreamed that
she had been a spectator to her grief.</p>

<p>Violet found Leonard in the hall. He looked relieved
at sight of her.</p>

<p>“I began to fear that you were never coming, sweetheart!”
he said, as he joined her. “So you have been
out in the grounds?”</p>

<p>Violet smiled. It was very pleasant to hear him speak
in the same old, tender way once more.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have been looking about,” she returned. “By
the way, Leonard, will you allow me to visit the east
chamber while I am here? It has long been a desire of
mine to do so.”</p>

<p>His face grew dark. He disliked the legend; and then,
it was told of the <i>Arleighs</i>, and Violet was an Arleigh.</p>

<p>“It is nothing to be proud of, dear,” he said, quietly.</p>

<p>Violet’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“Indeed I am not proud of it, Leonard,” she cried;
“but I wish to see the room very much. And, after all,
it was my ancestors of whom the story was told. But
there comes Hilda!”</p>

<p>Hilda floated into the room, a radiant vision, all in
pure white garnitured with black velvet, looking lovely,
as she always did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>At sight of the two alone together, her face grew stern;
but she forced a smile to her red lips.</p>

<p>“Come, Leonard, let us go out into the grounds,” she
began, gayly, monopolizing Leonard, as usual.</p>

<p>It struck home to Violet’s heart in that moment that
the engagement between Leonard and herself ought to
be made public, and then Hilda would not be quite so
officious. But just then Mrs. Rutledge made her appearance,
and they all went out into the grounds together,
where they remained until luncheon was announced.</p>

<p>At the lunch-table they found Jessie looking pale and
subdued, but outwardly calm. No one seeing her would
have dreamed that she had been going through the stormy
scene such a little while before out in the grim and silent
grounds.</p>

<p>Luncheon over, they all made a call upon Mrs. Yorke.
As they entered the great Gothic chamber a tall, gaunt
female in a rusty black gown, and wearing a cap upon
her scanty gray locks, strode out of the room with the
air of a tragedy queen.</p>

<p>“That is Betty Harwood—mother’s maid,” volunteered
Leonard. “She is quite a character, and mother
thinks she could not exist without Betty.”</p>

<p>Something struck to Violet’s heart with an odd feeling
of certainty, that she was destined to know more of this
woman before she left Yorke Towers. She had caught
a swift glance from her small gray eyes as she had passed
Violet in her exit from the room, and that glance had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
made the girl slightly uneasy. She felt almost <i>afraid</i> of
the woman.</p>

<p>“I must be getting nervous and fanciful,” Violet said
to herself, with a smile. “Betty Harwood is Mrs.
Yorke’s maid, and has been with her for many months.
She is devoted to the invalid. I am a foolish girl to
imagine any harm in her. The woman’s history is too
well known to Mrs. Yorke, doubtless, for her to be anything
that she ought not to be.”</p>

<p>Yet, strive as she might, Violet could not divest herself
of the impression, and a feeling of uneasiness lingered
in her heart.</p>

<p>Later in the day she encountered Betty in a deserted
corridor. The old woman gave her a furtive glance
from her little gray eyes, with their scant light lashes, and
nodded mysteriously.</p>

<p>Violet turned coldly away. She certainly wished no
secret understanding with Mrs. Yorke’s servants. But
as she passed on down the long corridor, old Betty glided
softly to her side, and bending her head, whispered in a
hissing tone:</p>

<p>“Be on your guard! There is fraud and wrong-doing
around you. You have been fearfully wronged, young
lady. No; you need not shrink from me in that cold,
scornful fashion. Take my advice and visit the east
chamber at the first opportunity. Stay there as long as
possible, and if you <i>can</i> stay there alone, do so. Never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
give up the search until you have proved my words to be
true.”</p>

<p>Violet lifted her head with a haughty gesture.</p>

<p>“I shall complain to Mrs. Yorke of you!” she said,
sternly. “I share no secrets with Mrs. Yorke’s servants;
please remember that!”</p>

<p>But as she passed on down the corridor and descended
the staircase, Betty’s keen gray eyes followed the slight
figure with a malignant expression, and she muttered
hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Ah, my fine young lady, you will be glad to take all
that back, and look to old Betty for assistance, before
many days have come and gone. There is trouble coming—awful
trouble for you, Miss Violet Arleigh, and
I would save you if you would let me!”</p>

<p>Then she went slowly back to Mrs. Yorke’s chamber,
that inscrutable expression still upon her wrinkled face,
and her gray eyes full of sullen wrath.</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">VIOLET OBEYS.</div>


<p>As Violet passed Mrs. Yorke’s door, she heard a faint
voice call her name. She paused at the open door of the
room.</p>

<p>“Did you speak, Mrs. Yorke?” she asked, timidly.</p>

<p>The invalid’s pale face flushed slightly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Will you come in here a moment?” she asked.</p>

<p>Violet entered the room and went over to the bedside.
Mrs. Yorke was dressed in a silken wrapper, and lay
upon the bed, her eyes shining with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“Violet Arleigh,” she began in a low tone, when the
girl had come to the bedside and paused awaiting her
pleasure, “I invited you here to Yorke Towers for a
purpose. I have never liked you or your mother; <i>she</i>
knew well the reason why. Violet Arleigh, I wish to ask
you a question: do you care for my son?”</p>

<p>Silence! You could hear distinctly the beating of the
girl’s frightened heart as she stood there before her censor—a
little black-robed figure, her bright head bent, her
eyes fixed upon the pale, eager face of the sick woman.</p>

<p>“You have asked me a question, Mrs. Yorke,” the
girl said, quietly, “which I have no reason to be ashamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
of answering. Yet you should have first spoken upon
this subject to Leonard; the subject of my engagement
should have been first mentioned by him, and not forced
upon me. I do not deny the truth, Mrs. Yorke, I <i>do</i> care
for your son very, very much—with all my heart, and
I mean to make him a good, true, devoted wife!”</p>

<p>“Ah! So that <i>is</i> the situation, for sure?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke’s voice was coldly sarcastic in its tone.</p>

<p>“I am quite pleased to be taken into your and Leonard’s
confidence at last; though it strikes me as being a
little late, when you consider that Leonard is my only
son—my only child. Strange, that he should have neglected
to mention the matter to me!” she added, thoughtfully.
“I can scarcely believe that he is really in earnest.
Why, I might never have heard of the matter at
all, and might not have suspected any sentimental folly
between you two, but for some remarks let fall by one
of the neighbors. Then I asked Miss Glyndon some questions
in regard to the affair, and although she was very
prudent and careful concerning what she said, I could
see that she looked upon the matter in the same light that
I do. Miss Arleigh, I ask you, do you expect to marry
my son?”</p>

<p>The question was abrupt, not to say rude. Violet’s
checks flushed, then grew pale as marble; her eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>“If I did not expect to become his wife some day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Mrs. Yorke,” she said, firmly, “I would never have
promised to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I suppose not. Well, you may go now; I
wish to be alone,” Mrs. Yorke added, curtly. And with
flaming cheeks and flashing eyes, Violet left the room and
sought her own apartment. At its door she encountered
old Betty Harwood.</p>

<p>“So you have seen madame? And I rather guess you
didn’t get too much kindness and courtesy!” cried the
woman. “I tell you, Miss Arleigh, Mrs. Yorke is half
crazy, and, in my opinion, she is a dangerous person to
deal with. She thinks that there is no one on earth but
her son. If I were you, I would have your engagement
publicly announced.”</p>

<p>But without a word, trembling with indignation so that
she could not speak, Violet entered her own room and
closed and locked its door.</p>

<p>“I will not stay here,” she pouted, angrily, as soon as
she was alone. “I have been outraged and insulted upon
every side, by my hostess herself and by her servant.
How dared Mrs. Yorke speak to me as she did? I am
just as good as she. The Arleighs are every bit as good
as the Yorkes.”</p>

<p>For a moment Violet’s anger was so intense that she
even forgot her love for Leonard Yorke. She felt only
indignation at his mother’s insults and the insolence of
old Betty. Yet all the time, away down in the depths of
her sore little heart, Violet was conscious of a feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
which corroborated the words to which she had just
listened. If Leonard Yorke loved her well enough to
wish to make her his wife, why did he not openly announce
the engagement between them? Why did he not
at least tell his own mother, and not leave it for her to
find out from strangers, or to put the delicate questions
to Violet with which she had just tortured her?</p>

<p>“I will go to Leonard at once,” decided Violet, when
the first paroxysm of anger was over and she was a little
more calm. “He must explain to me his reasons for this
strange secrecy, and set it all right, or our engagement
shall be at an end.”</p>

<p>She descended the outer staircase which led from her
own room to the grounds, and the first person upon whom
her eyes fell was Leonard himself. But he was not alone;
Hilda was with him—Hilda, with a pale and eager face
uplifted to his own, and a look of pleading in her beautiful
dusky eyes.</p>

<p>It was a pretty <i>tableau</i> as the two stood together under
a large tree, with the evening sun, setting just behind the
distant hills, casting a golden glow over the green grass,
and touching the silvery river with jeweled finger-tips.
But Violet, in the bitterness of her heart, could see no
beauty in the scene or the pretty picture.</p>

<p>“Leonard!”</p>

<p>Hilda’s voice was perfectly audible, and reached Violet’s
ears distinctly where she stood concealed from view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
by trailing vines of Maréchal Neil roses which hung all
around her.</p>

<p>“I have thought of this so many times,” went on the
soft, sweet voice of Hilda, “and I have wondered if you
really cared for Violet, or if—if you did not care a little
for me.”</p>

<p>Pale and trembling, Violet still hesitated, while the
soft, sweet voice went on:</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> have cared, Leonard, for, oh, ever so long! I
thought that you surely knew it, or at least suspected my
secret.”</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken. With a low moan of heart-break,
Violet turned and swiftly retraced her steps up
the narrow staircase, back to her own room.</p>

<p>“Hilda”—Leonard’s voice broke the silence at last,
with a tone of intense regret and grieved surprise—“Hilda,
believe me, I never dreamed of this. I—I
thought that you knew how dearly I love Violet; and our
engagement would have been announced but for her
mother’s death. Violet is my promised wife.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” Hilda Rutledge faced the young man
with a pale, angry countenance, and her voice rang out
clear and cold. “Leonard, your own common sense
ought to show you that Violet is dead in love with Will
Venners.”</p>

<p>That old jealous pang contracted Leonard’s heart with
a sharp pain. He turned away. Then his eyes wandered
to Hilda’s pale face, and his own grew white as death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Hilda,” he said, quietly; yet there
was something in his heart all the time which contradicted
the assertion. “Violet is my betrothed wife, and
she loves me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. I have no more to say. Only you will
find out the truth some day, then you will remember my
warning.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Violet had returned to her own room,
pale and wrathful.</p>

<p>“Let her win him if she can!” she panted. “I will
not stand in her way. If Leonard cares for Hilda Rutledge,
he shall have the chance to win her. If Hilda cares
for him—and I have suspected it long—she shall have
every opportunity to gain his love. I would not have his
love unless it was free and spontaneous. But he shall
trifle with me no longer. I am determined upon that
point.”</p>

<p>As the words passed her lips, she heard the rustle of
woman’s garments, and a woman stepped over the
threshold and entered Violet’s room.</p>

<p>It was old Betty. She held in her hand a huge key;
upon her ugly face a strange look of determination hovered.</p>

<p>“Here, Miss Arleigh,” she began at once, an ugly grin
overspreading her wrinkled countenance—“here is the
key to the east chamber. Just you go there yourself and
see what you can find. It will be a grand thing for you
if you should find the papers that I have reason to believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
are hidden away there. Do not hesitate a moment, or be
at all afraid. Mrs. Yorke will never know. See? Now
is your time. There is no one around.”</p>

<p>She seized Violet’s hand in a strong grasp, and before
the girl could utter a protest, she led her swiftly to a long
passage which separated the main building from the eastern
portion of the house.</p>

<p>“There!” whispered Betty, in a stage whisper. “Just
you follow that passage to the end, then unlock the door
before you, and you will be in the east chamber. Once
there, search everywhere for the package of papers which
will give you your own.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">IN THE EAST CHAMBER.</div>


<p>For a moment Violet stood irresolute. It seemed wrong
for her to obey the instructions of Mrs. Yorke’s servant
and visit the mysterious chamber all alone; but then she
knew that old Betty was a confidential servant, that she
had served Mrs. Yorke faithfully for years, and that she
knew much concerning the private history of the Yorkes.
But that Betty had some object in impressing upon
Violet the desirability of visiting the east chamber, was
only too apparent.</p>

<p>Violet stood turning the question over in her mind for
some moments. A strange desire to visit the east chamber
began to take possession of her heart—a desire augmented
by the unusual circumstances and surroundings
of the case.</p>

<p>“After all, Mrs. Yorke can have no objection,” she
said to herself, decisively; “and it is an understood thing
that we are all to make a visit to this historic room while
we are at the Towers, and if I choose to go there by myself,
I do not know that I am doing anything very improper.
And if old Betty Harwood had not been intrusted
with the key, how could she have it in her possession?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Therefore, she must have some authority in the
matter. On the whole, I believe that I will go.”</p>

<p>It seemed quite like visiting a modern Bluebeard’s
chamber. There was a spice of adventure in the affair,
and the hour, too, was propitious for such an adventure;
for it was twilight now. The long, narrow passage
which led to the east chamber lay in darkness. Violet
felt a little thrill of terror creep slowly over her as she
passed through the deepening gloom.</p>

<p>“Well, if I intend to go at all I had better make a
start,” she exclaimed, half aloud, with a sudden movement
in the direction of the long, gloomy passage, “or
I shall be compelled to get a light to find my way.”</p>

<p>She moved on hastily down the long, dark, narrow
passage—on, on! Surely never was a corridor so long
and gloomy before. On, on! Her outstretched hands
came in contact with the great oaken door of the mysterious
chamber at last, and Violet came to an abrupt
halt as her hands touched the stout panel. Then she
guided the key to the lock, inserted it, and turned it
swiftly. She felt a nervous desire to get the visit to
this chamber of horrors over with. Now that she had
begun the adventure, she would not give up or retreat.</p>

<p>Slowly the heavy door creaked upon its rusty hinges,
and a great dusty space lay revealed beyond her—the
east chamber. Trembling in spite of herself, Violet
crossed the threshold and stood within the room. A
damp, musty odor greeted her; the vault-like atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
of a room shut up from fresh air for years, only opened
at long intervals to gratify some one’s curiosity. Violet
drew a long breath, and stood gazing about her with
fear-dilated eyes. A large, bare room containing absolutely
no furniture—nothing, only over in one corner
upon the dusty floor a small heap of ashes, which had
blown from the empty fireplace, and lay piled up there
suggestively. Violet thought involuntarily of the dead
man, the poor sinner who had met his awful fate, the
lingering, dreadful death from slow starvation, within
this dreary room, and for just a moment she half believed
that the little heap of feathery gray ashes lying before
her at her very feet were the ashes of the dead—all that
remained of that which had been Wayne Arleigh, her
ancestor. But second thoughts assured her of the impossibility
of such a thing. Surely, neither the Yorkes
nor Arleighs were such heathens as to leave the ashes of
the dead unburied, no matter what the crime of the dead
man might have been.</p>

<p>With slow, reluctant steps, and trembling all over like
a leaf, Violet stole softly to the furthest corner of the
room and gazed eagerly about her. Where could she
search for papers hidden away in this bare, utterly unfurnished
apartment?</p>

<p>All at once a sound broke the awful silence of the
place, the sound of a stealthy footstep creeping slowly
near.</p>

<p>Her heart beat so loudly that she could hear it distinctly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
the cold perspiration stood in clammy drops upon
her forehead. She stood still and listened.</p>

<p>It was enough to terrify a stouter heart than Violet
Arleigh’s; for she knew well that this portion of the
great house was deserted, and no one knew of her visit
to the east chamber, save old Betty. The footsteps must
be those of some marauder, or else could it be something
supernatural?</p>

<p>A vague and undefined terror of she knew not what
took possession of the girl. Pale and trembling she stood
there, not knowing which way to turn; and slowly but
surely the footsteps drew near and nearer. They did
not seem to come from the same direction from which
she had come; they sounded apparently from the left
side; yet Violet knew that there was nothing there but
the wall of the house.</p>

<p>What should she do? Here in the darkness—for it
was nearly dark now within the ghostly chamber—she
would be compelled to face an unknown presence. It was
enough to terrify a stronger heart than hers.</p>

<p>On, on, came the ghostly footsteps. Violet turned to
fly. She <i>could not</i> stand quietly within that horrible
chamber to face this unknown terror. She would meet
it half-way.</p>

<p>Pale and panting, she darted to the door. It was
pushed softly open wide, and a man stood before her.
One glance into his face, and Violet recoiled with a low
cry of terror. Ah! this was worse than ghosts or supernatural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
visions, for the man before her was Gilbert
Warrington!</p>

<p>With an inarticulate cry Violet fell back. Warrington
put his arms about her and drew her to his breast.</p>

<p>“I have come to you here in this ghostly room,” he
said, in a low, impressive voice. “I have been waiting
and watching for this hour to come; and now that it is
here, Violet Arleigh, you shall go with me this very
night!”</p>

<p>Violet drew back and faced the villain before her with
pale face and kindling eyes. Well, at least this was
something tangible to combat. Better to face a real
danger than to fear some dreadful visitant from another
world.</p>

<p>“How came you here?” she demanded, harshly.
“Who has betrayed me to you?”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah! so you come here alone, at dark, to search for
certain documents which you fondly believe concern your
welfare?” he sneered. “But between you and me, Violet,
you will never get your hands upon them. When you are
my wife, then and then only will you come into possession
of the papers and secure your rights. You had better
yield to me and become my wife at once, Violet. I do
not love you, but I intend to have the Arleigh fortune.”</p>

<p>She waited to hear no more. With a stifled cry she
darted past him so swiftly that he had no time to detain
her—on through the darkness, down the outer staircase,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
out into the grounds, and straight into the arms of a man
coming swiftly up the walk from the opposite direction.
It was Will Venners. And just then, at the library window,
a few feet away, Leonard Yorke appeared, his
moody eyes fixed upon the scene, taking it all in.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">VIOLET ATTEMPTS A TRUCE.</div>


<p>Violet was so overcome with terror and surprise, and
so nervous and overwrought, that for a time she could
only stand there, Will’s arms about her, his face, pale
and startled, bent over her own, his eyes full of tender
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Violet—Miss Arleigh!” he cried, and his voice trembled
as he spoke, “what <i>is</i> the matter? What has
frightened you so? For I am sure that you were frightened
at something. You came running down the staircase
yonder as though some dreadful creature were in
pursuit. Come, let us go over to that rustic seat under
the magnolia-tree yonder, and sit down for a few moments.
To tell the truth, Miss Arleigh, I had wished
very much to see you, and it seemed as if my good fortune
precipitated you directly into my arms.”</p>

<p>Violet did not see the stern white face at the library
window, where her modern Othello stood glaring down in
speechless wrath upon the scene. It looked like a love-scene,
certainly; to the jealous imagination of the lover it
looked like a meeting between two who cared for each
other.</p>

<p>“I would never have believed it, if I had not seen it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
with my own eyes,” muttered Leonard, harshly; as if it
were possible for him to have witnessed the scene with
any other eyes than his own.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the two unconscious culprits had
seated themselves upon the rustic seat under the drooping
branches of the magnolia-tree, with the pale silvery moon
just creeping forth from behind a light fleecy cloud,
gazing down upon the pair with calm, smiling eyes—that
same old moon that has played so many tricks in its time
upon lovers, and has misled more than one jealous, suspicious
swain such as I am sorry to say—but truth compels
me to admit it—that Leonard Yorke has proven
himself to be.</p>

<p>That same tricky moonlight, playing hide-and-seek
among the green leaves of the drooping magnolia boughs,
showed Violet very pale and still at Will Venners’ side.
His handsome face was bent over her own, and he was
speaking in a low, earnest voice.</p>

<p>Not one word that he uttered could reach Leonard’s
ears, and therefore he naturally imagined that Venners
was making love of the fiercest description to his not unwilling
listener. But in reality this is just what Will was
saying:</p>

<p>“I have ventured here to-night, Miss Arleigh, though
it was quite a time before I could make up my mind to
come, for I know that for some reason Yorke does not
like me, and only invited me here from common civility;
but I felt that I <i>must</i> make one more effort to see Jessie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Glyndon before I go. I have decided to go out to Texas,
you see. There is no use in my remaining here, and—and
I love her so, Violet, I can not bear to stay here, and in
time see her wedded to another—not that I know of any
other that she cares for just now. Do—do <i>you</i>, Violet?”
with a wistful glance into Violet’s face, quite as though
he were anxious for her to say <i>yes</i>. Yet, in truth, he was
half wild with consternation lest she should corroborate
his secret fears.</p>

<p>Violet shook her head, with a slight smile. She felt
sorry for Will from the very bottom of her warm,
womanly, sympathetic heart.</p>

<p>“No; I am <i>sure</i> there is no one else, Will,” she returned.
“And, indeed, I—I don’t see how Jessie can help
caring for you. I mean”—stopping short, with a vivid
blush overspreading her pale face as she realized what she
had said—“I mean that I think that she <i>does</i> care.”</p>

<p>“Bah! she has a strange way of showing it, then!”
retorted Will, bitterly.</p>

<p>A sudden impulse, a sweet, gentle impulse, came into
Violet’s heart to try and help these two who seemed playing
at cross-purposes, all that might lie in her power. Not
to <i>interfere</i>—Violet had a horror of all interference or
meddling in such cases; to her they seemed sacred as
private—but perhaps she might be able to advise and
counsel a little in a time like this.</p>

<p>“Will”—her eyes shone like diamonds—“suppose
you let me go into the house now, this very moment, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
ask Jessie to come out here to see you? It would be so
much nicer and more romantic out here in the moonlight
than to sit in state in the big, grand drawing-room, with
Aunt Constance playing propriety, and Hilda watching
you with quizzical eyes. I know Jessie would not like
that, and she <i>would</i> like the moonlight and the <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with you. What woman could help it?” with unconscious
flattery. “Shall I go and ask Jessie to come out here,
Will? Remember you are going away, and it will be
good-bye.”</p>

<p>Will’s face was pale as death, and his dark eyes shone
like stars.</p>

<p>“I want to see her, Heaven knows I do!” he said,
sadly; “but suppose that she should refuse to come, Miss
Arleigh? It would nearly kill me!”</p>

<p>“She shall not refuse! I will not give her the chance.”</p>

<p>Violet rose to her feet with an air of determination.
She felt quite maternal in her regard for this distressed
young lover, and her heart was full of the desire to help
him and Jessie out of this slough of misunderstanding;
for somehow Violet felt that there <i>was</i> a misunderstanding
somewhere.</p>

<p>“She shall have no chance to refuse, even if she meditates
a refusal,” said Violet, resolutely. “I will steal a
march upon her. Just wait here a few moments, Will—only
a few moments—and I will see what I can do.”</p>

<p>She glided swiftly, softly away, a slight little figure in
its black gown, with pale face and resolute eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Will’s glance followed the slender figure, and a slight
moisture crept into his eyes as he murmured softly:</p>

<p>“Heaven bless her kind heart!”</p>

<p>Into the house went Violet, swift and eager. In the
hall she encountered Miss Glyndon on her way upstairs
to Mrs. Yorke’s room with a sleeping-potion. After administering
it, she was expected to sit by the bed and read
aloud to the sleepless, nervous invalid until at last sleep
should overtake her.</p>

<p>Violet went straight up to Mrs. Yorke’s companion
and laid her hand upon the white sleeve of Miss Glyndon’s
dress.</p>

<p>“Jessie, let me take that up to Mrs. Yorke,” she said in
a pleading tone; “and you—you go out into the grounds
for a little while. It will do you good to get the fresh air.
You are looking very pale.”</p>

<p>Jessie Glyndon’s large gray eyes met the earnest gaze
of Violet’s with a swift, half-startled expression in their
depths.</p>

<p>“I—looking pale? Why, you must be mistaken, Miss
Arleigh. I was never better nor stronger in my life.”</p>

<p>“But that is not the question,” persisted Violet; “and
I want you to go out for a walk for a little while. Come
with me, Jessie. Let Mrs. Yorke wait for this for once.
It will not hurt her to wait, and it is so very early—hardly
nightfall yet. Why should she wish to sleep at such an
early hour as this? No wonder she is wakeful and nervous
later in the night, if she goes to sleep with the birds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
in this fashion. Here, give me the potion; I will assume all
responsibility. Now come with me out into the grounds.
Really and truly, I will admit that I have a reason for
making the request—not half a bad reason, either; and
as it is the very first request I have ever made of you, I
am sure you ought to gratify it.”</p>

<p>Violet took the vial from Jessie’s hand, and slipping
her arm about the girl’s waist, led her half resisting
(though never for an instant suspecting the truth) out
through the open door into the pearly, moonlit night.</p>

<p>Violet’s face wore a look of determination that was
really unique, and her dark eyes gleamed with delight as
she led her captive swiftly down the broad walk in the
direction of the magnolia-tree and the dark figure, in its
well-fitting suit of brown serge, seated upon the rustic
bench.</p>

<p>Jessie drew back with a startled exclamation as the
moonlight glinted across his face.</p>

<p>“There is some one there, Miss Arleigh,” she whispered.
“See! it is a man.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” cried Violet, innocently; “and as true as
I live, Jessie, it is Captain Venners! Why, Captain
Venners!”—in a tone of Jesuitical surprise—“when did
you arrive?”</p>

<p>Will was shaking hands with Jessie, trying to ignore her
very palpable coldness, trying in vain to look into her
eyes and read the story hidden there. But, alas! it was
Sanscrit to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Now, I will hurry back to Mrs. Yorke,” interposed
Violet. “And you need not make haste at all, Jessie;
Captain Venners will entertain you, I am sure; so I’m
off!” and before Jessie could attempt a word of protest,
Violet flitted away up the path to the house, and
Jessie and Will were alone together.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">IN THE CORRIDOR.</div>


<p>Silence! The moonlight, glinting down through the
magnolia boughs, showed two still figures standing there
like statues. Jessie’s eyes were fixed upon the ground;
her graceful figure trembled perceptibly; her two white
hands were clasped tightly together. No sound to break
the silence, only the distant ripple of the shining river
gliding on in the moonlight. And then, all at once, just
over their heads, a mocking-bird burst forth into a perfect
shower of song. Clear, sweet, and silvery it rose
and fell upon the silence like fairy music, faint and soft,
in a tender minor key, then, soaring aloft, was lost in the
heavens.</p>

<p>Will’s voice broke in upon the silence which followed
as the bird flew swiftly away.</p>

<p>“Jessie”—his voice trembled audibly—“I am very
glad—I can not say how glad!—to see you once more. I
have come to say good-bye!”</p>

<p>“<i>Good-bye?</i>” The word fluttered from her lips in a
broken whisper. “To—say—good-bye?”</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden return of the olden pride, she
straightened her graceful form, and the big gray eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
met Will Venners’ gaze, clear and calm and straight-forward,
without a shadow or a shrinking.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am come to bid you farewell. Let us sit
down here, Jessie. It is a lovely night—a divine night!—and
I suppose it will be a long time—a very long time,
perhaps—before you and I will sit side by side again;
perhaps never—that is for you to say.”</p>

<p>She cast a swift glance into his eager, impassioned
face, and her eyes drooped once more.</p>

<p>“For me to say?” she repeated, falteringly. “I have
nothing to say in the matter, Captain Venners.”</p>

<p>“Jessie, see here!” He flashed about and caught her
hand in a swift, warm pressure. “I can bear this no
longer, and I will not! Either you love me or you do not.
Tell me the truth. I can <i>try</i> to bear disappointment like
a man. It will be very, very hard, but it must be as you
say. Listen, Jessie, and let me tell ‘the story of my
thralldom.’ I love you—love you with all my heart and
soul. I have been a wild sort of a fellow, flirting with
every passably pretty woman who was silly enough to let
me. I have flirted away my best days in this idle pastime,
and have won for myself the unenviable reputation
of a flirt; but lately I have awakened to a new life, new
hopes, new ambition—say, rather, for the first time, <i>real</i>
ambition. A feeling of disgust and aversion for my
career as a trifler has taken possession of me. I feel
the need of a real aim, a true object in existence. I have
at last found the missing joy of my life which my heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
has ever been seeking. In other words, I have learned
to love with all my heart and strength—<i>you!</i> Is my love
in vain, my darling? Is there no answering chord in
your dear heart, no hope for me? Answer me, Jessie;
for I am very, very unhappy in this long suspense.”</p>

<p>How could she doubt him? his pale, earnest face; the
dark, passionate eyes, eager and beseeching, bent upon
her own; the whole attitude of the man breathing the
true, unchanging love which filled his heart.</p>

<p>Yet how could she believe him? Before her memory
there danced a tantalizing vision—innumerable well-known
flirtations, every one of which might mean as
much as this, and more.</p>

<p>How did she <i>know</i>? She would not be the first woman
who had been deceived by a man, and misled by specious
pleading to her own unhappiness. She was not the first,
and she would not be the last.</p>

<p>And Will Venners was so much sought after and admired,
and so welcome in society, while she—what was
she but a poor girl, a hired companion, paid the same as
Betty Harwood, or any other hireling at Yorke Towers?</p>

<p>Jessie Glyndon was proud—very proud; and she felt a
horrible fear that Will Venners was merely trifling with
her, just for idle pastime. It might be amusement for
<i>him</i>, but for <i>her</i> it would be death—worse than death;
for Jessie Glyndon was the sort of woman who could not
endure the burden of life if once deprived of love. She
was all alone in the world, and accustomed to her cold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
loveless existence; but once let the sun of affection arise
upon her life, its setting would mean her utter ruin and
destruction. Better to grope on in the darkness in her
lonely way than to reach out and gather the proffered
flower of love, only to see it wither in her grasp.</p>

<p>Jessie could not believe, with the poet, that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis better to have loved and lost,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Than never to have loved at all.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She knew all that love would mean to her if once she
should gain it; and to lose it would leave her bankrupt
indeed. And this love which Will Venners was proffering
her—how did she know, how could she be certain
that it would be firm and stable? How did she know
that it would last?</p>

<p>She sat still and white in the moonlight, and Will’s
hand held hers and his eyes were fixed upon her pale,
calm face.</p>

<p>“Jessie,” he whispered, softly, bending his handsome
head a little nearer, “you surely are not altogether indifferent
to me? Surely you care a little for me, or have
I been a conceited fool to imagine such a thing possible?
I have thought of you by night and day; I wrote to
you, but received no reply; I have thought and thought,
and tried to find some way to your heart, but you have
seemed so cold, and hard, and stern, that I began to despair.
And then I concluded to go away; to leave you
and the sight of you forever; to say good-bye to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
home here, and return no more. For it all seemed so
hopeless—this love of mine. But at the last moment
my courage failed me. I must see you and tell you good-bye,
even though you spurn me from you, Jessie. I leave
it all in your hands—my life—my love—my future.
What are you going to do with me?”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his face. Strange that she could
not still that unquiet voice in her heart which kept whispering
of perfidy and deception, and reminding her of the
endless flirtations in which Will Venners had engaged
until he was past master in the art.</p>

<p>“Answer me, Jessie!” he pleaded, softly, “do you
care—or——”</p>

<p>He never finished, for across his words there came a
strange interruption. A wild shriek resounded through
the silence—a piercing, awful shriek. It came from the
house—from the upper windows, not far from where the
two were sitting—from Mrs. Yorke’s chamber. Jessie
started to her feet, pale and trembling.</p>

<p>“It is Mrs. Yorke!” she cried. “Oh, heavens! what
has happened? I ought not to have left her so long. Let
me go, Captain Venners—let me go!” (for he had caught
her hand as though to detain her). “I should not have
left my post so long. Let me go, Will, <i>darling</i>!”</p>

<p>The last word scarcely articulated as she wrenched her
hand from his eager clasp. But softly as the word was
faltered forth, Will heard it; he dropped the little hand,
but not until he had hastily pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Like a wild creature, Jessie fled to the house, followed
by Will, in no very enviable frame of mind. In after
years, looking back upon that moment, Will Venners was
wont to say that only the thought of the lone whispered
word that Jessie had let fall had kept him from some
desperate deed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, let us go back to the time when Violet
had left the lovers alone under the magnolia-tree, with
the prospect of a speedy explanation. She entered the
house and went hastily up the great winding staircase
to Mrs. Yorke’s room.</p>

<p>The upper corridor was quite dark, for the lamps had
not been lighted. The house was very still. She could
hear distinctly Leonard’s voice in the drawing-room below,
reading aloud to Mrs. Rutledge and Hilda—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Sweet is true love, though given in vain—in vain!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All the rest of the house was wrapped in profound
quiet as Violet turned down the corridor in the direction
of Mrs. Yorke’s room. She was thinking to herself that
if the sick woman would allow her to take Jessie’s place
that night, she would try hard to make Mrs. Yorke like
her, and for Leonard’s sake, who knew but that she might
be beguiled into a more tender feeling for her future
daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>As Violet hastened down the corridor, she saw two
dark forms standing in the passage which led to the east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
chamber. Trembling with terror, she halted to see what
they were.</p>

<p>Through the gloomy shadows she was able at last to
distinguish that it was a man and a woman—Betty Harwood
and Gilbert Warrington. And as Violet paused,
trembling and faint, she heard the man say softly:</p>

<p>“Well, <i>kill</i> her, then! After all, it would only be legalized
murder.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A FEARFUL DEED.</div>


<p>Violet stood transfixed with horror as these strange
words reached her ears. What did they mean? How
came Gilbert Warrington here, and upon such apparently
confidential terms with Mrs. Yorke’s trusted servant?</p>

<p>Violet’s heart swelled with bitter indignation against
the old woman, and she made up her mind to expose her
villainy and have her punished as she deserved.</p>

<p>All at once, like a flash, it occurred to Violet that Betty
Harwood had acted in conjunction with Warrington, and
had plotted to betray her into his hands. That was why
she had planned and insisted upon the girl’s solitary visit
to the east chamber.</p>

<p>It certainly seemed quite probable that there was a
conspiracy between the two, and that Betty was in Gilbert
Warrington’s employ—his tool and confederate.
Yet it was an awful thing to reflect upon. And what
could Betty’s object be in acting this traitorous part?</p>

<p>But there was no time for conjecture; the thoughts
had flashed through Violet’s brain and left no answer.
She felt that she must <i>act</i>.</p>

<p>She glided like a small black-robed ghost a little nearer
the entrance to the passage where the two stood engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
in low, eager conversation, and standing close against the
wall, so as to escape observation, she listened to what
came next.</p>

<p>“True,” old Betty was saying, in a low, hushed tone.
“But, then, there is always fear of detection; and we
have failed in one well-laid scheme to get possession of
the girl. I thought that you would have everything your
own way, when once you got her to visit the east chamber;
and when she would find herself alone with you in
that gloomy place, I thought the rest would be easy. But
you let her slip through your fingers, and now you must
stand the consequences. Unless you forcibly abduct her,
you will never get a chance again. Hush-h! what was
that? I thought I heard something in the passage down
there near the door. No; I suppose it was imagination.
Well, then you are ready to strike the decisive blow? It
shall be done to-night. Remember, we share equally.”</p>

<p>“Equally. But, Betty, the girl must not be hurt in any
way.”</p>

<p>“Bah! you are getting soft-hearted in your old age!”
snapped the woman, viciously. “Of course, there shall
be no violence done. Trust me for that. And now comes
the hard part. I must prepare for a trying ordeal, Gilbert.
We understand each other? There will be no failure
this time through mistake or misunderstanding?”</p>

<p>“There will be no failure,” he returned, grimly; “only
carry out your part, and I will do the same. Hist! the
old woman is calling you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Through the silence there sounded the silvery tinkle
of a little bell. Betty uttered a low exclamation.</p>

<p>“She rings as if she is out of temper,” muttered Betty,
harshly. “Oh, well! I don’t believe she will trouble me
with her overbearing tyranny much longer. I’m off, Gilbert.
Don’t forget the arrangements.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Make haste, or the old woman will
arouse the house.”</p>

<p>Betty disappeared swiftly in the direction of Mrs.
Yorke’s chamber, and Violet stood still in the darkness
and waited for Gilbert Warrington to leave before she
would dare return to the inhabited portion of the house.</p>

<p>A strange feeling weighed down her heart like a load—a
certainty that <i>something was about to happen</i>. What
was wrong? What awful calamity was about to fall upon
the house of Yorke?</p>

<p>She thought of the two faces dimly revealed by the
faint light from the hall-way—the face of the man dark
and ferocious, the crafty eyes glowing with evil fire, the
thin, compressed lips, the huge yellow teeth like the
fangs of a wolf about to spring upon its prey. Then she
recalled the face of the woman—the wrinkled, sallow
countenance, with its cruel eyes and ugly mouth, and it
was not pleasant to think of.</p>

<p>There was something sinister in it all, and Violet could
only wonder why Mrs. Yorke had retained her so long
in her employ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“I will follow her,” the girl said to herself, “and see
what evil deed she is about to do.”</p>

<p>Gathering her skirts closely about her, she glided down
the narrow passage, keeping close against the wall, and
so emerged at last into the outer corridor, leaving Gilbert
Warrington still at the extremity of the long, dark passage
which led to the east chamber.</p>

<p>Once in the main corridor, Violet paused an instant to
collect her thoughts; then she darted swiftly, noiselessly
along to the door of Mrs. Yorke’s room. It stood wide
open. Violet slipped into the room and concealed herself
behind it. The position of the door was such that she
could easily see, without being seen, all that was taking
place in the room.</p>

<p>This is what she saw: Mrs. Yorke was lying in bed,
propped up by pillows. Her face was turned away from
the door, consequently she had not seen Violet’s sudden
appearance in her room. At the bedside stood old Betty.
Mrs. Yorke’s back was turned to her, and she was speaking
in querulous tones.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what detains Miss Glyndon,” she was
saying. “I sent her down-stairs for a fresh bottle of the
sleeping-draught, which was in the store-room, and also
to bring a book from the library to read to me as usual.
It must have been a full hour ago, but she has not returned.
I shall discharge her to-morrow. I can not trust
her. She is not fit to be in my employ. Nobody is
prompt and punctual and reliable like <i>you</i>, Betty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“No, ma’am; nobody could be more so, I am sure.
But I work from the heart, ma’am,” returned the old
hypocrite, blandly; and Violet’s heart swelled with indignation
as she listened to the false words from the wicked
old woman.</p>

<p>“Will you have the sleeping-draught now, ma’am?”
added old Betty, sweetly.</p>

<p>“Yes; I <i>must</i> sleep. You will find the old bottle on
the table yonder. There is still enough left for one more
dose. Give it to me, Betty, and let me sleep.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>There was something awful in the cruel voice. Violet
felt the blood run cold in her veins. She stood quite still,
her eyes riveted upon the old woman’s movements.</p>

<p>Betty drew a small vial from her pocket, and removing
the cork, dropped a portion of its contents into a wine-glass;
then she returned the cork to the vial and slipped
it back into her pocket, after which she stooped over the
invalid, with pale face and stern, compressed lips.</p>

<p>“Here,” she said in a trembling tone; “here is your
sleeping-potion, ma’am. You will soon sleep well!”</p>

<p>She lifted Mrs. Yorke’s head upon her arm and held
the glass to her lips. The sight broke the spell which
seemed to enchain Violet’s faculties, and with a wild
shriek which resounded through the house she sprung
forward, and with one swift blow dashed the wine-glass
from Betty’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t touch it, Mrs. Yorke!” cried Violet in a clear,
ringing voice. “It is poisoned!”</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, out went the light, leaving the room
in total darkness. A tall form glided swiftly into the
room, and Violet felt herself seized in strong arms, and a
hand pressed over her mouth, and then she was borne
swiftly away.</p>

<p>When Leonard Yorke and Jessie Glyndon, startled by
that awful shriek, reached Mrs. Yorke’s room, they found
her upon the bed in strong convulsions, and old Betty in
a dead swoon upon the floor.</p>

<p>And Violet—where was she?</p>

<div class="chaptitle">A TERRIBLE SECRET.</div>


<p>Violet felt herself borne rapidly away in the strong
arms which held her; away, she knew not whither. It
was melodramatic; it was like a scene from a sensational
novel; but this recollection did not lessen the poor girl’s
terror. In vain she struggled and tried to shriek aloud
for help; the heavy hand closed tighter down upon her
month; her breath grew shorter and fainter, and at last,
in sheer self-defense, she ceased to struggle or to try and
raise an alarm. At length, after what seemed an endless
time, her abductor came to a halt, and she was placed
upon her feet.</p>

<p>“There, my lady,” said a harsh voice in her ear, “you
are safe at last—safe in my hands.”</p>

<p>That voice, that hated voice! She realized the truth
at once; she was in the power of Gilbert Warrington.
A cold, sickening sensation crept over her heart and
chilled the blood within her veins. In the power of this
villain, what hope was left for her? Where was he taking
her? Why had he abducted her? And what was the
meaning of the words to which she had listened between
old Betty Harwood and Warrington? She felt her heart
stand still with terror, then with a mad bound it throbbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
on once more. Panting in breathless silence, she extended
her hands; they came in contact with the trunk of a tree.
The cloak was removed from her eyes; she glanced wildly
around her. She was in the woods somewhere behind
Yorke Towers, alone in the night with Gilbert Warrington.</p>

<p>He stood before her glaring down into her frightened
face with wild eyes full of triumph.</p>

<p>“So you know the situation at last, my lady,” he
sneered. “You are in my hands, and it will be many
a long day before you get out again, I can assure you,
unless you will consent to my wishes. Violet, if you
will marry me at once, I will swear to leave you and
never come near you again. I want the Arleigh fortune,
and if you will secure it to me by marriage, I will never
trouble you more. You shall be as free as the bird of
the air. What do you say, Violet?”</p>

<p>“I say that you are a villain, Gilbert Warrington, and
that I would sooner die than become your wife.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I fancy you will change that decision when
you learn the full extent of my power over you. Violet
Arleigh, shall I tell you the secret which I have held over
your mother’s head for many a year, the secret which I
had threatened to expose the very night that she—she
died. It terrified her so that she attempted to take her
own life.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it! I do not believe that my mother
would ever think seriously of such a dreadful thing as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
suicide!” cried the girl, excitedly. “I believe that you
are speaking falsely. You are a bad man—a false, bad
man, and a villain, if ever there was one!”</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington smiled. Even in the dense shadow
of the trees, through which the silvery moon-rays could
scarcely penetrate, Violet saw that smile, and a chill crept
over her.</p>

<p>“This is all mere waste of time and breath, you know,
my dear,” he observed, harshly. “I am going to have
my own way in this matter, and you may as well yield
peacefully as otherwise, for yield you <i>must</i>! Now, Violet,
I ask you once more, would you like to learn the
nature of the secret which blackened all your mother’s
life and made her afraid of her own shadow—a secret
which I alone shared, and which I held over her head
until she longed to die to escape the knowledge—a secret
for which she paid dearly in more ways than one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” panted the girl, desperately, “she paid
<i>you</i> well, you blackmailer and extortioner! I knew that
there was something hidden in the past for which she
was suffering and atoning with her very life. I know
nothing of the nature of that secret; but I do not believe
that it has anything to do with dishonor if it had any
connection with my mother!”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed! What confidence, to be sure! It is
truly touching. What a blow it will be for you, my
dear, when you learn the truth—that your mother was
base and vile and wanton——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Stop! So help me Heaven, you shall not breathe such
words against my pure mother, a saint in Heaven! Dare
to open your lips to speak such vile words again, Gilbert
Warrington, and I will find some way to punish you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you? It is something like the mouse and
the lion, now, isn’t it, my dear? Yet the truth remains
the same. There is a black and awful secret connected
with your mother’s past which, if it were known to Mrs.
Yorke, for instance—and I can not say how much that
lady already suspects—would effectually cut off all tender
passages between yourself and her beloved son.
Helen Yorke is far too proud to allow her only son to
ally himself with disgrace!”</p>

<p>“He would never do that by marriage with an Arleigh!”
cried Violet, proudly.</p>

<p>“No? There, now, you see just how little you know
about it, my dear. Disgrace is not a pleasant word, but
it ofttimes blackens the fairest escutcheons; and so it has
done in this instance. Your mother, my dear Violet, was
an uncommonly fine woman—she must have been to have
held my heart captive for all these long years; but all
the same, there was a time in her life when she made a
misstep as well as many another woman. Many a proud
lady of fashion and position carries a black secret hidden
away in her heart; and Rosamond Arleigh was thus
burdened, for she kept hidden away for years the knowledge
that her marriage with Harold Arleigh was a sham—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
mere farce—and that you, her only child, are illegitimate!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!”</p>

<p>The words fell from the girl’s white lips in a broken
gasp, a bitter cry of mortal anguish and wordless suffering.
She fell upon her knees upon the ground and
wrung her small hands in bitter agony.</p>

<p>“Gilbert Warrington, beware!” she cried at length, a
mad hope that he was tricking her springing up within
her heart; “beware how you slander my mother, my
poor dead mother! So help me Heaven!”—she arose to
her feet and stood gazing with eyes full of despair into
the man’s cruel face—“I will hold you accountable for
this! I will go to the authorities in the morning, and
you shall prove what you assert, or suffer as you deserve!
It is beyond endurance! It is terrible that I
must stand here, helpless and alone, and listen to such
fearful words from the lips of a bad man like you!
Monster! fiend! have you no heart, no pity, no mercy,
no feeling of humanity? Surely the world does not
need a devil while such men as you exist!”</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington laughed softly, and his wicked
eyes twinkled with malicious satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Well done, well said, my dear little spitfire!” he
sneered. “Storm away, my little tempest in a teapot;
I like to hear you. It is the most amusing scene that I
have witnessed in many a day. Reminds me of a tiny
toy terrier snapping at the huge heels of a great Newfoundland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
and has just about as much effect. All the
same, Violet Arleigh, my words are true. Do you think
me silly enough to make such grave assertions without
being fully convinced of their truth? You must be mad!
No, my dear; I have known for several years that Rosamond
and Harold Arleigh were never legally married.
What is more, Helen Yorke suspects the truth. She was
dead in love with Harold Arleigh, herself, and I was
dead in love with Rosamond, so we are fellow-sufferers,
she and I. No, Violet, I am not deceiving you nor slandering
the dead from brutal motives; I am telling you
the plain, hard truth. It is time that you knew it. And
I am prepared to prove this grave charge, <i>if</i> you wish the
secret exposed to the light of day, the secret which killed
your mother. But I offer you terms. Marry me, Violet,
share the fortune with me, and I promise to keep the secret
to the end of time.”</p>

<p>The girl drew back, her eyes flashing fire.</p>

<p>“If I am not Harold Arleigh’s legitimate child, I am
not his legal heir,” she said, coldly; “therefore, the Arleigh
fortune will not go with my hand to anybody. Gilbert
Warrington, you have overreached yourself in this
game. Even I, with my limited knowledge and experience,
know better than that.”</p>

<p>“But, Violet, you forget the fortune was bestowed
upon your mother by Harold Arleigh in the shape of a
deed of gift. You are her legal heir, and, at all events,
the will which she left—oh, you know nothing of it, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
see!—leaves you sole heir. It is a comfortable fortune,
and that fortune I mean to have. But I must first make
you my wife; so, Violet, my dear, you had better listen
to reason, for you can not escape me again.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A DARK SUSPICION.</div>


<p>All was confusion at Yorke Towers. Betty was soon
restored to consciousness, only to tell a wild and incoherent
tale which astonished her listeners.</p>

<p>She had been standing at the bedside of her mistress—Miss
Arleigh was present also—and Betty was about to
administer Mrs. Yorke’s sleeping-draught at her request,
when all at once a man rushed into the room. At
the same instant the lights were extinguished, and Mrs.
Yorke uttered a piercing shriek, for she was fearfully
alarmed.</p>

<p>After that there was the sound of retreating footsteps
in the darkness, and then Betty had lost consciousness
and knew no more.</p>

<p>Leonard Yorke listened to the old woman’s absurd
story with a pale, stern face and dark, wrathful eyes.
Jessie and Mrs. Rutledge had begun to resuscitate Mrs.
Yorke, while Hilda flew to summon the servants and
send for a physician.</p>

<p>All was excitement and confusion in the house, and a
pale, terrified group gathered around Mrs. Yorke’s bedside.</p>

<p>In the midst of it all Leonard stole away and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
out into the open air for a time, to collect his thoughts
and try and arrange some plan of action.</p>

<p>Where was Violet? Surely it was time that she was
found! He sought eagerly, anxiously, through all the
lower rooms of the house, then slowly and dejectedly
ascended the staircase to return to his mother’s apartment.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs he encountered Hilda. She
was pale as death, and her dusky eyes gleamed with a
curious, brassy light.</p>

<p>Leonard laid his hand upon her arm with a force that
made her wince.</p>

<p>“Hilda”—his eyes burned into hers as he gazed full
into their depths—“we must find Violet—find her at
once! Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>She was trembling like a leaf; her hands were as cold
as ice.</p>

<p>“Of course we will do all in our power to find her,
Leonard,” she returned, sweetly; “but is it not foolish
to insinuate that she is <i>lost</i>?”</p>

<p>“True.” He looked relieved. “She may be in her
own room all this time. Go and see, Hilda, will you
not?”</p>

<p>She smiled a cold smile, which chilled him somehow.</p>

<p>“I do not mean that she is still here,” she returned,
slowly; “though of course I will go to her room and see
if she is there. I mean this, Leonard: You know that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
she and—and Captain Venners were in the grounds together
to-night, do you not?”</p>

<p>Leonard Yorke’s face grew white as death. Across
his memory there flashed the scene in the shrubbery,
where he had seen Violet—<i>his</i> Violet—in Will Venners’
arms.</p>

<p>“I—know!” he gasped, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Hilda’s face wore a look of triumph.</p>

<p>“Well, since you know that he was here to-night,
does it not strike you as a little odd that he should not
have entered the house, but should meet Violet (of
course by appointment) out in the grounds? They were
out there together ever so long. Leonard, it is my belief—you
need not say anything to anybody, of course,
until we are sure—but it is my belief that they have gone
away together.”</p>

<p>“<i>Hilda!</i>”</p>

<p>“I can not help it; I can not help believing this to be
the case. Of course, you will say that no elopement
would be carried out under such circumstances; but I
believe that old Betty Harwood knows or suspects more
than she cares to tell.”</p>

<p>“But, Hilda, I thought, I fancied that I saw Captain
Venners with Miss Glyndon when the alarm was given.”</p>

<p>Hilda looked blank.</p>

<p>“That is easily proven,” she returned. “I will see
Jessie and ask her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>By this time the physician had arrived and had taken
charge of Mrs. Yorke.</p>

<p>Jessie was standing alone in a deserted corner. Hilda
hastened to her side.</p>

<p>“Miss Glyndon,” she began in a low tone, “was not
Captain Venners here a little while ago?”</p>

<p>Jessie’s face grew crimson, then went white as marble.</p>

<p>“Yes; he was here,” she returned, quietly; “but he
has gone. He left some time ago; in fact, just after the
alarm was raised. I advised him to go, for he could be
of no assistance here.”</p>

<p>“Well”—Hilda’s dusky eyes were fixed full upon
Jessie Glyndon’s honest gray ones—“has it not occurred
to you that he and—and Violet have gone away together?”</p>

<p>“Impossible! preposterous! Captain Venners would
never think of such a thing—nor Violet, either,” she
added, swiftly.</p>

<p>Hilda suppressed a smile.</p>

<p>“Dear me, what touching confidence, especially in
Will Venners!” she cried. “Why, Jessie, did you never
hear of his escapade with Mrs. Montford, the wife of a
certain New Orleans merchant? He actually eloped with
her. Why, you <i>must</i> have heard of it; all New Orleans
was ringing with the scandal at the time. <i>No?</i> Well,
that <i>is</i> strange; but it is true, nevertheless. I tell you,
Will Venners is a seasoned flirt—a wild fellow who will
never get done sowing his crop of oats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“But, Miss Rutledge,” Jessie’s voice rang out in indignant
protest, “if you are convinced of Captain Venners’
baseness, at least you ought to spare your cousin. Violet
Arleigh would never be guilty of such an act as running
away with any man. And why, in the name of
Heaven, should she run away? She is virtually her own
mistress, and will be legally so in three years’ time, when
she will come into a handsome fortune. She need not
elope with any man, for she can marry the man of her
choice, and no one has a right to object. Besides, she is
engaged to Mr. Yorke.”</p>

<p>“It is not true!” cried Hilda, wrathfully. “I do not
believe it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” returned Jessie, quietly, “that is as you
please. But at all events, Mr. Yorke loves her—I am
convinced of that.”</p>

<p>Hilda flounced angrily away, and went over to where
Leonard was standing pale and stern.</p>

<p>“The whole affair is shrouded in mystery,” she said
in a low tone. “It is only clear that Violet and Captain
Venners were together a little while before the alarm,
and now they are both gone. That is all that I can discover.
You had better go over to town, Leonard, and
make inquiries.”</p>

<p>But Leonard shook his head.</p>

<p>“If she has gone away with Captain Venners, I have
no right to interfere,” he returned, coldly; “such interference
on my part would be absurd. If it is really true—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
dreadful surmise of yours, Hilda—she will probably
become the wife of this man at once and return to
The Oaks. But why, in Heaven’s name, should she have
chosen to take such a strange course, she who could have
married as she pleased? I do not understand it at all,
and it is that which makes me doubt appearances. But
we have not yet searched the whole house. Go at once,
Hilda, and see if you can find her in her room, while I
search the rest of the building.”</p>

<p>Somewhat sullenly, Hilda obeyed. No, Violet was not
in her own room or any other. Leonard procured a lamp
and went swiftly, silently through every room in the
unused portion of the great, old-fashioned mansion, ending
at last with a visit to the east chamber. There was
nothing to be found, no trace, no clew; only as Leonard
retraced his footsteps down the long, narrow passage
which led from the east chamber his eyes fell upon a small
object which lay upon the dusty floor. He stooped and
picked up a gentleman’s handkerchief of fine soft cambric;
in one corner was an elaborately embroidered letter
<i>W</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>W</i>—for <i>Will</i>,” he muttered, harshly; and Leonard
Yorke’s jealous heart gave a fierce mad bound, and then
stood still at this corroboration of his unpleasant fears.</p>

<p>In truth, the handkerchief belonged to Gilbert Warrington,
and the initial was intended for the first letter
of his last name; but, of course, Leonard knew nothing
of Warrington and his visits to Yorke Towers, consequently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
he could not suspect anything even near the
truth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke was now restored to a rational state once
more, but quite unable to converse, so nothing could be
learned from her, though in response to Leonard’s eager
questions in regard to Violet, she would shake her head
mournfully and look very sad.</p>

<p>At last, in the early dawn, Leonard Yorke rode away
from Yorke Towers, his mind made up, in spite of pride,
to ride over to the town and make inquiries. But first
he rode to The Oaks, and astonished and terrified the
servants there by asking for Miss Violet. No, indeed,
she had not been home; they one and all agreed upon that
point. So, after his fruitless search there, Leonard went
on to the town. Here he found food for reflection. Yes,
Miss Arleigh had been in town late the night before, accompanied
by a tall, dark gentleman, with a military air,
and they had taken the midnight train for New Orleans.</p>

<p>The station agent, who was an old acquaintance of the
Arleighs, had wondered at the late trip, but had concluded
that she had important business which had called
her to New Orleans at that late hour.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">IN A TRAP.</div>


<p>All Gilbert Warrington’s speeches were apparently
wasted upon Violet’s ears. She stood leaning against the
trunk of the tree listening in stolid silence to his words.
She knew that there was no hope of escape for her.
All alone with him in the forest at that hour, how could
she hope to get away from him? A little bird caught in
a wire trap might just as reasonably expect to get free
from its prison as this poor child, caught in the snare of
the relentless villain before her, bent upon carrying out
his own wicked designs.</p>

<p>All this flashed through Violet’s brain as she stood
there pale and trembling, facing Gilbert Warrington, her
girlish heart quailing from the thought of what might be
before her.</p>

<p>“You had better come with me, Violet,” he said, persuasively,
laying his hand upon her arm as he spoke.
“I will take you to New Orleans to-night. Once there,
we can be married, and you will then be at liberty to go
where you wish. I swear that I only want your money.
Give me the right to control it, and I will relinquish all
claim upon you. Your mother’s will leaves you the sole
heir to the Arleigh fortune when you reach your majority,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
or should you marry before that time. Now you
understand me?”</p>

<p>“I do. You are the vilest villain unhung!” she answered,
fearlessly.</p>

<p>“Ah-h! Well, that is as you like. Your opinion can
not injure me, my dear. All I want is the money, and that
I mean to have!”</p>

<p>“I will give it to you, every dollar of it, except what
is necessary to provide for my own living, only let me go
in peace.”</p>

<p>“Quite sensible, my dear Violet. Well, then, I propose
that you go with me to New Orleans this very night. No
time like the present. You shall be treated with the respect
due a lady. I will take you to the St. Charles Hotel,
and I will call for you in the morning with all necessary
arrangements for our marriage completed, after which
you will be at liberty to go where you like.”</p>

<p>“You need spare yourself the trouble,” intervened Violet,
coldly. “I shall never marry you, rest assured of
that. You must be mad if you imagine that you can intimidate
me in such a way. But I am willing to make a
deed of gift to you of all my fortune, save a sufficient
sum to support me, the deed to come into effect when I
am twenty-one—three years from now. Will that be satisfactory,
you miserable blackmailer?”</p>

<p>He smiled at her ignorance. But he must not let her
suspect his plan; he must get her to go to New Orleans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
and that very night, if possible. He can see his way to
success.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he returned, quietly, “I will consent. All
I want is the money.”</p>

<p>But low under his breath he muttered savagely:</p>

<p>“But I will not wait three years to take possession of
it. She is in my power completely now.”</p>

<p>“Will you go with me to-night, Violet?” he asked,
aloud, in a pleading tone. “I must have this business
settled immediately, for as soon as I am in possession of
your deed, I can realize enough on it for present use, and
will leave the country at once.”</p>

<p>Her face brightened at the prospect.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go to-night—as well now as later; and if
I return to Yorke Towers and let everybody know I am
going, there will be sure to be some objection made, and
probably Aunt Constance would put an end to the whole
thing. But first I must write a line to Leonard—Mr.
Yorke—and let him know that I am going away in this
strange and abrupt fashion, but will return to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Down in her heart she was saying to herself:</p>

<p>“I will humor this wicked man and obey him outwardly;
but once in the town, I will try and seek some
one’s protection and escape him. I will write to Leonard,
so that if I fail in making my escape from Gilbert
Warrington, he will be able to save me.”</p>

<p>She went with outward willingness the rest of the way
to the town and the railroad station. Here Warrington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
procured writing materials, and Violet wrote a hasty line
to Leonard, telling him that she had been forced to go
with an old acquaintance of her mother to the city on
important private business which she would fully explain
on her return the following day.</p>

<p>The letter written, she gave it to a porter to drop into
the mail-box outside the station-house. He was just in
the act of dropping the letter into the box, when a hand
came down upon his arm, and a voice hissed in his ear:</p>

<p>“Hold, my man! Give me that letter. This will pay
you,” slipping a five-dollar bill into the man’s hand.</p>

<p>A moment later poor Violet’s letter was in fragments
upon the ground, and then Gilbert Warrington, his evil
work done, went back to his victim.</p>

<p>The train was steaming in as fast as it could. Violet
had seen no one whom she knew, even the agent had been
too busy for her to get speech with him. There was no
chance to appeal to any one. Everything seemed against
her.</p>

<p>The tickets were purchased, and trying hard to feel
that this was only an ordinary trip, Violet allowed Warrington
to place her on board, and off they steamed for
New Orleans.</p>

<p>She really felt little apprehension over her strange
and late journey. Her mind was filled with the one
thought that the sooner it was over with the sooner she
would be free from Gilbert Warrington’s persecutions
forever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>She intended to go to a lawyer in New Orleans and
state the case, then see if nothing could be done to free
her from this villain’s clutches without the sacrifice of her
fortune.</p>

<p>The train reached New Orleans in the early dawn, and
Gilbert Warrington assisted Violet to alight.</p>

<p>She wore a long cloak with the hood drawn over her
head—a cloak which he had taken from the hall outside
Mrs. Yorke’s room, and had used to envelop Violet in and
smother her cries for help.</p>

<p>He led her to a cab, assisted her inside, then followed
quickly, having first given the driver some low-toned instructions.
The cab rattled away over the stony streets.</p>

<p>Violet began to feel a curious sensation of drowsiness
stealing over her senses. She closed her eyes wearily.
She began to realize vaguely that she had done a very
imprudent thing in coming to New Orleans with this man,
her bitter foe. A foolish step had she taken in her ignorance
and her mad determination to rid herself of her tormentor
forever at all hazards.</p>

<p>But while these doubts and fears strayed through her
brain, sleep overtook her and she knew no more. She
opened her eyes at last.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight now. But where was she?</p>

<p>All alone in a strange room. One window only, and
that was shielded by iron bars. An iron bedstead, a stool,
and a small pine table made up the furniture.</p>

<p>She was lying upon the hard bed. She lifted her head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
and tried to rise, but she was faint, and giddy, and sick.
She began to realize then that she had been under the influence
of chloroform, and that was how Gilbert Warrington
had brought her to this place without her knowledge.</p>

<p>To what a fool-hardy expedition had she lent herself!
What a foolish act had she committed! what a senseless
proceeding—to imagine that she, a simple, innocent young
girl, could outwit and circumvent a hardened villain like
Gilbert Warrington!</p>

<p>As these thoughts ran riot in her brain the key turned
in the lock of the door—until then she did not know that
she was a prisoner—and a woman entered—a coarse-featured,
crafty-eyed old woman, with iron-gray hair and
a forbidding aspect.</p>

<p>With a mighty effort Violet conquered the sick, giddy
sensation and rose slowly to her feet.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” she demanded.</p>

<p>The woman’s grim features relaxed with a cruel smile.</p>

<p>“Where you are safe, young woman—where all of
your kind ought to be. You are in Langley’s Private
Asylum for the Insane.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">IN DURANCE VILE.</div>


<p>Violet’s eyes flashed with indignation at the old
woman’s words. Surely, this was a grim jest; yet
equally certain was the girl that the announcement could
not be true.</p>

<p>It seemed the very height of absurdity. In this enlightened
age it was not probable that a young woman could
be carried forcibly away from home and friends and be
immured in a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>At least, this is what Violet thought and believed. She
did not know that such crimes are frequently committed;
that more than one innocent life has been condemned
to a lingering death behind the iron bars of an asylum
for the insane, when there was no trace of insanity in the
system of the unfortunate victim.</p>

<p>Influence and money have power to surmount the obstacles
which are usually placed in the way of a sane
person being treated as one bereft of reason.</p>

<p>There are always bad men to be found who for a sum
of money will consent to assist villainy like this—men in
high positions very often; and once in conjunction with
an unprincipled person with an object to attain—an object
which can only be attained by the death, or incarceration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
in a safe and secluded place, of the unfortunate
victim—a villain of this stamp can do almost anything.</p>

<p>For once let the name which is assigned to the victim
in place of his own proper cognomen be inscribed upon
the books at Langley’s as a lunatic just received there
for treatment, and that person is henceforth virtually
dead to the outside world, to home and friends, and all
ties that are dear to the human heart.</p>

<p>Down in the cold, dark grave, hidden away forever
from mortal eyes, the poor wretch will not be more utterly
lost to the world and its joys and sorrows.</p>

<p>Langley’s no longer exists. It was a blot upon the
fair name of the old Crescent City, and has been removed
forever from existence; but Violet, in her innocent ignorance,
had never heard of such a place at all. So, as
the woman stood boldly repeating her announcement that
Violet had been brought to Langley’s Private Asylum for
the Insane, her words did not bring their full weight of
terrible meaning.</p>

<p>But it was bad enough for Violet to know that she was
a prisoner in this place whither she had been brought
without her knowledge or consent, and she turned upon
the old woman with pale, wrathful face, and angry eyes
flashing with indignation.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded, haughtily.
“Who has dared to do such a thing? Who brought me
to this place, madame? Answer me, I command you!”</p>

<p>The old woman’s thin, compressed lips parted with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
cruel smile which distorted her ugly face into still greater
ugliness.</p>

<p>“<i>Who?</i> Why, who but your guardian, Mr. Warrington,
to be sure? He said that you had become suddenly
insane, your mind had lost its balance, and so
forth; and so he decided to leave you here for a time
until you came back to reason and common sense.”</p>

<p>Slowly the words, with their dreadful, hidden import,
sunk into Violet’s mind. She began to see in a vague way
the real state of the case. Of course this had all been
Gilbert Warrington’s doings, and the people here no doubt
believed that he had a right to dispose of her. Perhaps
they really believed her to be insane. That they had
deliberately aided and abetted the villain in his wicked
schemes seemed too horrible to be true. She could hardly
believe such depravity possible.</p>

<p>“Gilbert Warrington is a villain!” she said aloud, her
voice trembling with indignation. “I will very soon
prove his true character to the physician in charge of
this place. Go and tell the physician in charge that I
wish to see him, that I <i>must</i> see him a moment.”</p>

<p>A slow smile once more crept over the woman’s stolid
face.</p>

<p>“The physician in charge is Doctor Langley himself,”
she returned, tersely, “and he has seen you already.”</p>

<p>Violet started with a suppressed cry.</p>

<p>“Seen me already!” she repeated, in a startled tone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
“Then it must have been while I was in an unconscious
condition!”</p>

<p>The woman nodded.</p>

<p>“He has seen you and has given his opinion as a physician,”
she said in a harsh voice. “That is all that is
necessary. He is competent to judge your condition,
whether you are asleep or awake.”</p>

<p>“Go and send Doctor Langley to me,” repeated Violet,
disdainfully. “I wish to see him.”</p>

<p>The old woman hobbled away, closing and locking the
door behind her.</p>

<p>The moments came and went—ten, fifteen, twenty.
Violet began to despair, when all at once she heard a
soft, stealthy footstep in the hall without. A moment
later the key turned in the lock and the door swung
open.</p>

<p>Violet flashed about and saw standing before her a
man of some five-and-fifty years. He had a bald head
and a fat, shiny face, blear eyes and sandy mutton-chop
whiskers. A man with a soft, shuffling gait, a burly
figure, and a generally unpleasant air. He looked what he
was—a hypocrite, a villain.</p>

<p>The girl felt her pure soul recoil from the sight of the
creature, and the glance of his small, crafty eyes made
her shiver with disgust. She felt like the helpless little
bird which is safely caged and trapped.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” began the man in an oily, insinuating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
voice, “you wished to see me, so Mrs. Carter says. What
can I do for you, my dear?”</p>

<p>“What can you do? You can let me out of this place,”
panted Violet, desperately. “Doctor Langley, if you are
he”—the bald head bowed like a Chinese mandarin—“I
have been brought to this place while in an unconscious
state by the worst villain unhung!”</p>

<p>She might have added, “present company excepted,”
had she felt in a facetious mood; but Violet had no
thought for anything but her own desperate position, and
her wild desire to escape from it as soon as possible.
Doctor Langley bowed once more.</p>

<p>“Really now, is he, my dear? I am sure I would
never have thought such a thing of Mr. Warrington. He
has been a pleasant friend of mine for many a long year.”</p>

<p>A cold feeling of despair settled down upon the poor
girl’s heart.</p>

<p>“That settles it, then!” she cried. “If you are Gilbert
Warrington’s friend, then you are as bad as he.
There is no help for me in this world!”</p>

<p>She sunk upon the iron cot once more, and hid her face
in her hands. After a while she lifted her eyes to the
shining, self-satisfied countenance before her.</p>

<p>“Doctor Langley, will <i>you</i> not help me?” she pleaded
in a broken voice. “If you will, there is nothing within
my power that I will not do to repay you. Only let me
out of this place, and give me money enough to pay my
fare home, and I will leave in your hands a written guarantee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
to pay to you on your order, within a week, any
sum of money that you may name.”</p>

<p>His beady eyes glistened with a greedy light, and Violet’s
heart leaped up from zero to fever heat, only to go
down again to the very depths of despair, as the oily insinuating
voice fell upon her ears once more.</p>

<p>“Impossible, my dear young lady, quite impossible,”
he returned, blandly. “You forget that you are a minor,
and no written or verbal guarantee of yours would be
legal. I would have to trust to your honor to furnish
the sum you refer to, which would have to be a good
round figure, I assure you. And then, besides, you would
be more than apt to give away the secret of this institution—and
its existence is a secret from the city authorities—though,
of course, everything is carried on in a perfectly
straight, square, and lawful manner. But I have
reasons of my own—private and weighty reasons—for
wishing its existence kept a profound secret from the authorities.
So I am forced to decline your offer.”</p>

<p>“I swear to you——”</p>

<p>Violet’s voice was choked with tears. She fell down
at his feet upon the bare, dusty floor, and lifted her
pale face and pleading eyes, from which the tears were
streaming. It was a sight to touch a heart of stone.
But this villain’s heart was harder than stone, in fact, he
had no heart to touch.</p>

<p>“Oh, hear me and believe me!” she moaned, wringing
her hands in wild supplication. “I will keep my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
word. I swear it! I will send you the money—whatever
amount you claim—and will swear by everything
sacred to keep the secret of this place. Oh,
believe me, sir, I beg of you! Indeed, I am incapable of
false dealing.”</p>

<p>The greedy look in the small eyes deepened; he clinched
and unclinched his damp, unwholesome-looking hands.</p>

<p>“I really can not do it, my dear,” he repeated, firmly.
“And, if I am not mistaken, there is Warrington now,
come to make a call upon you!”</p>

<p>For a loud ring at the gate bell had broken in upon
the doctor’s words. Violet’s face grew stern and set, and
her eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>“I will see him face to face, and he shall set me free,
or”—she caught her breath with a stifled groan—“there
will be some dreadful deed done. I will not endure this
persecution any longer!”</p>

<p>The words died upon her lips; for there before her,
facing her with an evil smile, was Gilbert Warrington!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">LEONARD HEARS ALL.</div>


<p>Half wild with jealous wrath, and nearly heart-broken,
for he had loved her well, Leonard Yorke rode like a
madman back to Yorke Towers, back to his mother to
break the shameful news.</p>

<p>He took a different road home from the one by which
he had traveled to the town. This road lay through the
dense forest which stretched out, dark and gloomy, in
the rear of Yorke Towers.</p>

<p>As he rode on through the sweet-scented pine woods,
his eyes fell upon a small object, a fragment of cloth,
which hung upon a blackberry bush and fluttered in the
breeze as he passed by.</p>

<p>It was a little thing, an insignificant thing; but, somehow,
Leonard felt a strange impulse to stop and investigate.</p>

<p>Dismounting, he approached the bush and carefully
examined the bit of cloth. He uttered an exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>It was a fragment of the very dress that Violet had
worn the night before—a bit of black lawn, soft and fine
in texture. Surely there was no mistake. He carefully
detached it from the bush and placed it in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>As he was about to turn away, his eyes chanced to
fall upon some foot-prints plainly imbedded in the damp,
moist earth at his feet—small, dainty foot-prints—and
near by a larger impress, evidently the foot-prints of a
man.</p>

<p>As Leonard paused to examine with eager anxiety
those tell-tale signs, he saw something black lying on
the ground at the foot of a tree. It looked like a small,
black snake coiled up in the sunshine.</p>

<p>He stooped closely and gazed eagerly at the thing.
Surely, he was on the right track; he had made no mistake.
<i>Violet had been at this place</i> the night before.
What he saw lying at the foot of the tree was a jet
bracelet, one of the very pair which Violet had worn
the previous night when she had so strangely and mysteriously
disappeared from Yorke Towers. With a stifled
groan he picked it up, and slipping it into his pocket,
turned away.</p>

<p>He <i>knew</i> now; he was convinced; he saw it all. Violet
had indeed gone away with Will Venners; though why
she should have taken such a course, Leonard was unable
to guess.</p>

<p>They had evidently come by this secluded and unfrequented
route to the town and the train; they had halted
at this spot, perhaps to arrange their future course; for
at this lonely place they would be quite alone, and in no
danger of being interrupted or overheard.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, and fully satisfied that the woman he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
loved was false, Leonard mounted his horse once more
and turned to go back to Yorke Towers. Overwhelmed
with his trouble, his mind quite preoccupied, he did not
observe the course that his horse was taking. He sat with
bowed head, his thoughts busy; and as he forgot to guide
his horse, the animal had everything his own way. So
he carried Leonard on, playing, as it happened, into the
very hands of Destiny.</p>

<p>When at last Leonard lifted his head, arousing himself
with an effort from the heart-broken reverie into which
he had fallen, he found himself in a lonely and secluded
spot on the edge of a dreary swamp; and there at his very
feet, lying upon the ground, was the body of a man.</p>

<p>With a suppressed cry, Leonard leaped from his horse
and made his way hastily to the side of the prostrate man.
Something familiar in his aspect struck to the young
man’s heart, and with a feeling of horror stealing over
him, he lifted the man’s head upon his knee and gazed
into the death-like face.</p>

<p>Powers above! it was Will Venners! He lay there utterly
unconscious, his head bleeding profusely from a
severe wound just above the temple. A trifle lower and
he would have been dead. For, although at first Leonard
believed that it was a corpse upon which he was
gazing, he soon discovered that the poor fellow’s heart
was beating a little—faintly and feebly, it is true, but
still it was beating.</p>

<p>Leonard laid the poor head gently down upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
ground once more, his heart stirred to profoundest pity.
Yet all the time he was conscious of a wild thrill of joy
and ecstatic delight to know that Violet had not eloped
with Will Venners, after all. And since it was not Will
Venners, why, then, there was some mistake, surely; for
there was no one else whom Leonard had the least reason
to suspect or fear.</p>

<p>He brought water in his hat from the bayou near and
bathed the brow of the unconscious man, and stanched
the blood, which, as it flowed profusely, would doubtless
be the means of saving his life.</p>

<p>At last Will opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“<i>Jessie</i>,” he murmured, faintly.</p>

<p>Leonard Yorke’s heart leaped up into his throat.
Could he have been on the wrong track all this time?</p>

<p>“What is the matter, old fellow?” he cried, feeling
all at once a wild desire to do something, anything, everything,
for this man, whom, until this moment, he had
madly, unreasonably hated. “How came you here?”</p>

<p>Will tried to lift his head, but he was too weak. An
awful, ghastly pallor overspread his face, and he fell back
upon the ground once more at Leonard’s feet.</p>

<p>“I—I was coming to her rescue,” he murmured in a
half whisper, speaking with great difficulty. “For—oh,
it is you, Yorke?” for the first time recognizing his companion.
“I am glad you are here, for you will help to
find her now. That man, that villain, I don’t really know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
who he is, but it is some one whom Miss Arleigh fears
and hates, has carried her away!”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>Leonard Yorke thundered forth the word like a madman.</p>

<p>“Explain!” he panted, fiercely.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will speak as rapidly and lucidly as possible,
Yorke, but I’ll confess I am pretty badly done up,
and it is very difficult to speak. You know, perhaps, that
I called at Yorke Towers last night to see Miss Jessie
Glyndon? I wished to bid her good-bye, as I intended
going over to Texas to remain. I’ll tell you why: I love
Jessie Glyndon, and I fear that I shall never win her,
she is so cold and proud, and reserved. It is evident to
me that she has heard frightful tales concerning me.
Some may be true, I am sorry to say, but no doubt they
have come to her highly spiced, and make me out much
worse than I am, or ever have been. Leonard, if I could
win that woman for my wife, I swear that I would be a
better man, that I would turn over a new clean leaf in
the history of my life. Well, I called to see Jessie, and I
met Miss Arleigh in the grounds. She was running
away from some one who had frightened her, a tall dark
man in a military cloak. She was frightened half to
death, and as I turned the corner of the avenue which
leads to the house, she nearly fell into my arms. After
I had quieted her, I begged her to let me see Jessie for a
few moments, and like the dear, good young lady that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
she is—she is an angel, Leonard—she proposed to help
me.</p>

<p>“Her plan was to go into the house and try and coax
Jessie out into the grounds; once there, she would leave
us alone, and we might be able to come to an understanding.
She did all as she had proposed. Jessie and I
were sitting under the magnolia-tree near the library
windows, when we heard a fearful shriek which seemed
to come from your mother’s room. Jessie rushed to her
assistance. I would have followed, but she bid me not
to come, and knowing that you were in the house to assist
in the emergency, and thinking that it might be embarrassing
for Jessie, I obeyed her, and with a hasty good-bye,
I left her. I hastened away from Yorke Towers,
and attempting to take the shorter route, I lost my way.
About an hour afterward, while knocking about in the
woods, I came face to face with the same man who had
frightened Miss Arleigh, and he was carrying her in his
arms. She was, to all appearance, unconscious. I stepped
boldly up to him and called him to account. But he
struck me over the head with something which he drew
from his pocket—I think it was a sand-bag—and I fell
to the ground like a dead thing. He must have brought
me to this forsaken place and left me. I do not know,
for I became insensible, and knew no more until I opened
my eyes just now to see you bending over me. That is
my story, told to the best of my ability. Where Miss
Arleigh is now, I do not know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>Leonard grasped Will’s hand in a firm grip.</p>

<p>“I want to beg your pardon, Venners!” he cried. “I
have wronged you cruelly. I have accused you of gross
wrong. I—I believed that you and Violet had eloped.”</p>

<p>Will started up with a wild cry, forgetting his injuries.</p>

<p>“You must be mad!” he panted. “I have never
thought of such a thing as caring for Miss Arleigh, only
as a dear, true friend. She loves you with all her heart,
even as I love Jessie Glyndon. It is the dearest hope of
my heart to one day win Jessie for my wife.”</p>

<p>Leonard caught the young man’s hand, and tears stood
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Can you ever forgive me, Will?” he cried. “I have
a long story to tell you; and then you will understand me
better. But first I am going to take you home with me
to Yorke Towers—to Jessie—she will nurse you all right.
After you are safe in her care, I am going to search for
my lost darling—my pure, sweet Violet whom I have so
foully wronged. I will never rest until I have found her
and begged her upon my knees to forgive me.”</p>

<div class="chaptitle">A RAY OF HOPE.</div>


<p>Violet’s eyes wandered coldly to Warrington’s dark,
saturnine face, and rested there with a look in their depths
that boded him no good.</p>

<p>“Gilbert Warrington,” she cried, in a clear, ringing
voice, which was full of scorn and detestation, “I demand
that you procure my freedom from this place! Let me
go free, or it will be the worse for you!”</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington bowed, and there was a mocking
devil in his crafty eyes as he responded:</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Arleigh, I am really very sorry that I
cannot comply with your request. I do not like to refuse
a lady anything, and especially a fair lady like yourself”—with
another mocking bow—“but truly, circumstances
over which I have no control, etc., etc., preclude the possibility
of complying with your demand. In short, my dear
Violet, not to put too fine a point on the argument, I <i>will
not</i> let you go free until you and I are husband and
wife!”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. Then I suppose I may look upon this
place as a living tomb, for I shall certainly never be your
wife! Death by inches in this horrible place would be
preferable to such a fate!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>Warrington fairly shook with rage, but he controlled
his wrath; and biting his lip to keep back the torrent of
angry words which were striving for utterance, he went
on:</p>

<p>“Whatever you may wish, your wishes shall not be
consulted. I am determined to have the Arleigh fortune,
and as I can legally obtain it in no other way save by
marrying you, I am going to make you my wife, though
I detest the sight of your white face and big, mournful
eyes. But <i>you</i> are only the means to the end—-the <i>desideratum</i>.
Unpleasant as you are, I shall have to use
you as a stepping-stone to fortune.”</p>

<p>Violet’s eyes flashed indignantly.</p>

<p>“And suppose that I decline to be a stepping-stone for
any one?” she demanded.</p>

<p>He smiled a slow, derisive smile.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, my dear, your wishes will not be consulted,”
he returned, insolently. “You see, Violet, you
are completely in my power—completely. You might
as well try to change the course of this earthly planet of
ours as to control me in any way. You are going to
marry me; there is no evading it in any way, so you may
as well resign yourself to the inevitable. To-night I shall
be here with a clergyman, and the ceremony shall be performed.
Then, and not until then, shall you be set
free.”</p>

<p>“I decline to accept my freedom upon such terms!”
cried the girl, bravely. “I prefer to stay here until I die!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
Gilbert Warrington, perhaps you may have heard of the
Arleigh will? If so, you need not be reminded that you
are wasting your arguments and your valuable time. <i>I</i>
have inherited the strong, unyielding will power of the
Arleighs, and I never give up when I am in the right!”</p>

<p>A dark frown disfigured Gilbert Warrington’s sullen
face.</p>

<p>“The Arleigh will? Ah, I know it indeed full well.
Harold Arleigh wrecked his whole life by his indulgence
in that unpleasant characteristic of his race. All the
same, I shall crush that will in this instance. Think how
absurd for you—a mere girl—to attempt to defy <i>me</i>.
And you are my prisoner, while I am free to carry out
my plans. In short, there is no use for further discussion,
you shall become my wife to-night!”</p>

<p>“I will die first!”</p>

<p>“You may die afterward,” returned the villain, brutally;
“but not until the conjugal knot is tied. After
that you may ‘shuffle off the mortal coil’ as soon as you
like. It shall be just as you say. I only ask your signature
to a certain document, after which you may take a
short cut to Paradise, if you like.”</p>

<p>Sick at heart, the girl stood staring bleakly before her,
her form trembling, her heart sinking. What a terrible
fate stretched out before her, and she so young and fair!
All for the sake of gold, the detested wealth that her
mother had left to her.</p>

<p>What should she do, what could she do? The question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
asked itself over and over in her numbed, bewildered
brain with tireless persistency. She could not think; she
was incompetent to plan or direct her thoughts. She
clasped her hands, and the look of suffering upon the
white, beautiful face would have wrung the hardest heart.
Appeal was useless; this creature before her had not the
heart of a man. He was a wild beast seeking whom he
might devour, and she might as well appeal to the mercy
of the robbers of the desert or the panther in its jungle
as to Gilbert Warrington.</p>

<p>“You understand me?” he continued, breaking the
silence which had fallen over the room; “I will be here
to-night at eight o’clock with a clergyman, all in readiness
to perform the marriage ceremony.”</p>

<p>She turned away as though she had not heard a word
that he had spoken.</p>

<p>“A still tongue makes a wise head,” he said, with a
coarse laugh. “If silence suits you, well, so it does me.
But to-night will end the controversy. As soon as you
have signed the document in my possession, signed it with
your new name of <i>Mrs. Violet Warrington</i>, I shall leave
you in peace and forever!”</p>

<p>She stood as silent and unresponsive as a stone image.
He gave her a glance of mingled hatred and triumph, then
he left the room, locking its door behind him.</p>

<p>Left alone, Violet started from the trance of numb
despair which was stealing slowly over her, and glanced
wildly about the small room. Thank Heaven, she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
rid of his hateful presence at last! Scarcely knowing
what she did, she went over to the window, a small square
window too high up for her to look from, and protected
by stout iron bars. An impulse seized her to look forth
and see where she was. Pushing the small table over
to the window, she climbed upon it, and so was able to
peep from between the bars. Below was a retired street
with only an occasional passer-by. But as Violet stood
gazing eagerly forth, she saw a man walking slowly down
the street, and once in a while casting a furtive glance
up at the building. A wild flash of hope went through
her heart, for the man was Detective Dunbar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A RAY OF HOPE.</div>


<p>For a moment Violet could scarcely believe the evidence
of her own senses. Could it be Dunbar, or was it
only a fancy, a freak of the imagination conjured up
from the depths of her half-distraught brain?</p>

<p>She had become accustomed to the detective, after her
mother’s supposed death, and had become familiar with
his personal appearance; so she gazed from the iron-barred
window now with eager, anxious eyes, to make
sure that she had not deceived herself.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Dunbar; there could be no doubt upon that
score. He was gazing up at the buildings with furtive
eyes, as though seeking for some one.</p>

<p>A negro girl lounged indolently out of the high, iron-barred
gate of the institution, and moved lazily on down
the street. Dunbar moved rapidly on after her. Could
he be seeking some one within the grim, forbidding walls,
and was the negro girl his accomplice? Perhaps she had
even been sent inside the grounds as a spy in his service.
And now that she had emerged from the dreary confines
of the asylum, had Dunbar waited to receive her report,
and was he following her now for that purpose?</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, Violet had hit upon the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
truth, the true state of affairs. She stood there gazing
forth upon the now deserted street with eager, devouring
eyes, a faint hope stirring feebly within her heart. Somehow
the glimpse she had had of Dunbar made her hope in
spite of her dreary surroundings and gloomy prospects.
There was something in the sturdy, cheery aspect of the
man which was conducive to hope and confidence. And
as Violet stood there vaguely turning over in her brain
the fact of his presence near her, the wild idea crossed
her mind, <i>was he seeking her</i>?</p>

<p>Improbable as the idea appeared at first sight, it lingered
within the girl’s heart and would not be expelled.</p>

<p>Her eyes followed the tall, straight figure of the detective
until he halted in the rear of an out-building.
The negro girl halted also. Violet, watching with her
very heart in her eyes, saw that Dunbar was engaged in
earnest conversation with the girl; and the way in which
he occasionally glanced up at the house made Violet hope
that his business with the girl had reference to some one
within the building; and if some one, why not herself?</p>

<p>It seemed absurd, but Violet Arleigh’s confidence and
faith in the detective’s powers were almost unlimited.
She knew that he had sworn never to give up his search
for Rosamond Arleigh, her poor, unfortunate mother;
then why should he not seek Violet also? She knew that
as soon as she would be missed from Yorke Towers there
would be great excitement throughout the country; so
Dunbar would know the truth at once, and perhaps he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
had tracked her down to the dismal prison-house in which
she was confined.</p>

<p>A swift impulse darted into her brain. If she could
only write a line and convey it to him in some way,
surely he would help her, even though his business at
the asylum should have no connection with herself.</p>

<p>Attached to her watch-chain was a tiny gold pencil.
She had no paper; but such obstacles are sometimes overcome
when one is in dead earnest, as Violet was now.
Smoothing out her pocket-handkerchief upon the table,
she managed to write upon it with the pencil:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Dunbar</span>—I am a prisoner in this place. If you
do not get me out before night, I shall be forced to marry
Gilbert Warrington, my mother’s hated foe.</p>

“<span class="smcap">Violet Arleigh.</span>”<br>

<p>Rolling the handkerchief up into a ball, she mounted
the table once more and peered eagerly forth, her heart
contracting with a sickening fear lest he should be gone.
No, thank Heaven, he is still in sight! The sash had been
removed from the window to admit the air; it was an
easy matter for Violet to carry out her hastily formed
plan. She drew close to the iron bars, and called aloud,
at the top of her voice, “Mr. Dunbar!”</p>

<p>The detective glanced upward. With an inward
prayer for help, Violet pushed the handkerchief, rolled
into a ball, through the bars; it fell at Dunbar’s feet.
He stooped and picked it up, his eyes seeking the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
with a swift, glad glance. He saw her and recognized
her. Thank Heaven! He lifted his hat with a little,
expressive gesture, which somehow made Violet’s heart
glad, and filled her with confidence as he walked away,
the handkerchief still clasped in his hand. She felt that
she was in safe keeping, and that there was hope for her
at last.</p>

<p>She watched the detective out of sight; then she descended
from her perch upon the table, and pushed it
back into its place; then she sat down to wait, she hardly
knew for what. But it was wonderful how that tiny hope,
and her confidence in the detective’s ability and willingness
to help her, had power to buoy up the girl’s sinking
heart, and make her strong in mind and body.</p>

<p>As she sat buried in thought the door of the cell
opened and old Mrs. Carter made her appearance. Her
ugly face wore a smile of triumph.</p>

<p>“So, my honey, ye seen the doctor, didn’t ye? And
great good it done you, eh, honey?”</p>

<p>Violet shrunk away from the coarse old creature, sick
with horror at being forced to endure her presence; and
even Violet’s inexperienced eyes could see that the old
woman was half intoxicated. And she was in the power
of a creature like this!</p>

<p>“I saw Doctor Langley—yes,” returned Violet, quietly.
“And what do you want here?” she added, abruptly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought I’d just ask if you ain’t ready for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
breakfast!” she responded. “Anything you want, jest
you order it, and then sit down and wait until it comes.”</p>

<p>It occurred to Violet then that she had better eat something
and try to keep up her strength; for that Dunbar
would find some way to help her before night, she was
almost certain.</p>

<p>“I will take a cup of coffee and some toast,” she said.</p>

<p>The old woman nodded her head like an automatic
figure.</p>

<p>“Oh! ye will, eh? Very well; you shall have it,” she
said.</p>

<p>She was leering at Violet out of the depths of her
crafty eyes, with an expression which made the girl’s
blood run cold.</p>

<p>“Go and bring my breakfast,” she commanded, coldly.
“That is all I want of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is, is it? Humph! Well, you shall have more
of me than you want, afore you’re through here, I
reckon. Your breakfast you shall have, miss, at once.”
And with a mocking obeisance she left the cell, not forgetting
to lock its door behind her.</p>

<p>Trembling like a leaf, Violet stood gazing after the
retreating figure, until the closing door cut off her view;
then she turned dejectedly away.</p>

<p>Tap! tap! Surely that was something tapping at the
iron-barred window. Even as she gazed, a folded paper,
attached to a long pole, appeared at the bars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>How did it come there? For the room was in the
third story.</p>

<p>She climbed upon the table once more, and secured
the note, for such it proved to be.</p>

<p>Then she saw that it had come from a neighboring
balcony, where the same negro girl whom she had seen
with Dunbar was busily employed in washing windows.
Violet’s quick brain grasped the situation. Dunbar was
helping her, even as she knew he would.</p>

<p>Hurriedly descending from the table, she opened the
note with trembling fingers.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Arleigh</span>,” it said, “don’t eat or drink
<i>anything</i> in this place, even though you perish of starvation.
But you shall not do that; for I shall have you out
of there this very night. Do all that you are told to do.
Go with Gilbert Warrington to your marriage. Be quiet
and obedient, and I will do the rest. <i>Trust me!</i> I will
not fail you.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Dunbar.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>With a glad thrill in her heart, Violet hid the precious
letter away in her bosom, and just in time; for at that
moment the old woman appeared with quite a tempting
breakfast arranged upon a waiter. She placed it upon
the table, and after a quick, suspicious glance around
the narrow room, disappeared once more.</p>

<p>When Violet heard the key turn in the lock, she went
over to the table, and taking the cup of coffee from the
waiter, emptied its contents into the empty grate which
occupied a corner of the room. The food she hid away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
under the fender, where it would not be seen; and having
disposed of the contents of the waiter, she went over
to the iron cot, and lay down as though to sleep.</p>

<p>Hours passed. The day slowly declined; the sun set
and night came down; still Violet lay there quite silent.
Several times during the day she had heard the door
open softly, and some one glanced into the room. She
understood. They were watching to see if the drug
which had been placed in her food had taken effect.
They meant to stupefy her so that she would be pliant
as wax in the hands of Warrington.</p>

<p>The hours rolled slowly by. Eight o’clock struck.
Then the door of the cell opened once more, and Gilbert
Warrington entered.</p>

<div class="chaptitle">WHAT CAME NEXT.</div>


<p>Violet shrunk back with an involuntary cry at sight of
the man whom she hated, and who had come to her now
to lead her forth to that hateful farce of a marriage,
from the very thought of which her soul shrunk back appalled.
Only the recollection of Dunbar’s promise to help
her kept Violet’s heart alive within her breast. He had
enjoined upon her to show outward obedience to Gilbert
Warrington, and to do as he directed her; to even go
through the farce of a marriage, if necessary, but to trust
to Dunbar to rescue her, even at the last moment. And
so, although the girl was half insane with horror over
the peculiar and terrible position in which she was placed,
she had made up her mind to follow Dunbar’s directions,
no matter what the effort might cost her. In fact, it
seemed the only resource—all that was left to her to do.</p>

<p>As for Gilbert Warrington, he could only stand and
gaze with wonder at the girl whom he had fully expected
to find under the influence of the drug which he
had caused Mrs. Carter to drop into the food and drink
prepared for her. He had entered the cell expecting to
see the poor girl lying upon her bed, half dazed and
wholly helpless—in his power, at his mercy. But there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
she stood before him, pale and calm, outwardly brave,
her large dark eyes fixed upon his hated face with a look
in their depths which made his bad heart quail. But he
recovered his self-control and moved swiftly toward her.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my dear Violet,” he began in a bland
tone. “I am glad to see you ready and waiting for your
bridegroom. Sorry that you could not have had a pretty
and more suitable wedding-gown; and it is said to be
unlucky to marry in black; but then, we can afford to
laugh at superstitious follies, and our marriage will be a
very happy one. Of course, I do not intend to insist
upon your living as my wife. As I remarked to you before,
you are at liberty to go to the antipodes if you see
fit, as soon as you are Mrs. Gilbert Warrington, and
have signed your name to the paper which I wish you to
sign. But it is quite eight o’clock; it will not do to keep
the clergyman waiting, and he is already arrived. Come,
my dear, let us go down. You are ready?”</p>

<p>She drew back, her lip quivering, her eyes flashing
with scorn and indignation.</p>

<p>“Ready to marry <i>you</i>, Gilbert Warrington?” she
cried, her voice ringing out clear and scornful. “No,
never! I shall never be that. But I have decided to
obey you, and I must submit to this horrible outrage
since you have me in your power. But, mark me, Gilbert
Warrington”—she paused, and her eyes wandered over
his face with a slow glance of scorn and hatred—“mark
me, sir, you will regret this step, and the hour is not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
distant when you will wish that you had died before you
forced me into this hated marriage!”</p>

<p>“Bah! My dear, I will chance all that. I understand
women and their ways and notions. I understand your
nature, my dear Violet, like a book, and I repeat that I
am willing to take all risks. As for regretting this step,
how can you say such a thing? I could never do that. It
means future fortune and position for me, and you may
go to—the ends of the earth, for all I care—afterward!”</p>

<p>She shivered and turned away.</p>

<p>“Well, are you ready?” he asked, after a moment’s
silence. “Eight was the hour appointed for the ceremony.
I don’t see the need of keeping the clergyman
all night. Come!”</p>

<p>He drew her hand through his arm and led her from
the cell, out into a long, bare corridor, and down a staircase,
another, and another, pausing at last before the
open door of a large, bare-looking reception-room. Violet
glanced hastily within, and her eyes rested upon a
scene which photographed itself upon her memory, never
to be forgotten while she lived.</p>

<p>In the center of the room stood the clergyman. He
was no impostor, no sham, for Violet had seen his face
before in the pulpit. He was a well-known minister residing
in the city, a good man who never for a moment
dreamed the truth in regard to the infamous wrong
which he was about to perpetrate, or at least be a party
to, and who never for a moment thought or suspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
that the house to which he had been brought to perform
the ceremony was a private asylum for the insane, or
those whom cruel enemies wished to make the world
believe were insane, and who immured within its gloomy
walls the unfortunates who chanced to stand in the way
of their wicked schemes.</p>

<p>When Violet saw this man, she realized that all hope
was gone, save her trust in Dunbar. If he should fail
her, then she was lost indeed. For there had been a faint
hope lurking in the depths of her heart that if she appealed
to the clergyman he might feel some pity for her,
and, at least, would investigate the case before he performed
the ceremony. But the girl realized intuitively
that here all hope was in vain. The clergyman evidently
fully believed that he was doing his duty, and nothing
that she could say would cause him to swerve a particle
from the path marked out for him. So she gave up all
hope in that direction, and with a cold, sinking feeling
at her heart, prepared for what was to come, while she
resigned herself outwardly to the inevitable.</p>

<p>What if Dunbar should fail her now in her extremity?
After all, she had only his word—the promise of a man
who was a stranger to her, save for the part he had played
in the search for her mother, and the fact that he was
Doctor Danton’s best friend. But this fact alone was a
passport to her confidence. Violet’s heart grew brave,
and hope revived within her breast.</p>

<p>“God help me!” she whispered, softly; then, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
leaning upon Warrington’s arm, she advanced to the center
of the room. The clergyman made a few trivial remarks,
then he opened the prayer-book in his hand, and
an awful silence settled down.</p>

<p>Violet observed then, for the first time, that Doctor
Langley and old Mrs. Carter were present, seated in a
corner of the room, evidently acting as witnesses. She
felt like the captive tied to the stake, around whom the
fagots are being heaped, while one stands ready with
lighted torch to apply to the pile, and certain and awful
death is inevitable.</p>

<p>Slowly the clergyman began to read the marriage
service. But the first few words only were uttered, when
there came a loud and violent ring at the gate-bell.</p>

<p>Doctor Langley and Mrs. Carter started to their feet,
pale and terrified. There was something ominous in that
sound which brought terror to their craven hearts.
Langley darted to the door of the room and laid his hand
upon the knob. <i>The door was locked upon the outside!</i>
The windows were barred with iron, like the others in
the building. With a hoarse, inarticulate cry he fell back,
and his face wore the look of a baffled fiend, an abandoned
wretch just betrayed to well-merited punishment.
Mrs. Carter crept to his side, trembling visibly.</p>

<p>“The game is up!” he muttered in a low aside to the
old woman. But softly as the words were spoken, they
reached the ears of the clergyman. He closed the prayer-book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“There is evidently something wrong here,” he observed,
sternly. “I will defer the ceremony until all is
explained.”</p>

<p>Violet darted wildly forward and caught his hand in
both her own.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, help me——” she was beginning; but at that
moment the door was thrown open and Dunbar the detective
marched into the room, followed by half a dozen
police officers in uniform. He went straight up to Warrington
and laid his hand upon the villain’s arm.</p>

<p>“Gilbert Warrington,” he thundered, “I arrest you in
the name of the law! Boys,” turning to the officers,
“secure yonder villain known as Doctor Langley. I accuse
him of being the owner and proprietor of an illegal
institution known as Langley’s Private Asylum for the
Insane, where <i>perfectly sane</i> people are imprisoned until
death releases them, or until the wicked purposes of
cruel and unscrupulous enemies are served. I rather
think, Mr. Warrington, that my charges against <i>you</i> are
too numerous to be specified. They run through the
whole scale of crimes, from attempted murder down to
abduction and embezzlement. Here, men,” addressing
the police officers once more, “just march this precious
pair, the old woman, too—quite a notorious trio—to the
parish prison, where they shall be dealt with as they deserve,
or Dunbar is out of his reckoning. Miss Arleigh”—he
drew Violet’s hand through his arm—“you will
come with me. I will protect you with my life. Did I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
not tell you to trust in me, and that I would save you?
I am here also to find your mother. I have traced her to
this city. Doctor Danton is also here; and, with the help
of God, Rosamond Arleigh shall be found!”</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">A SECOND ATTEMPT.</div>


<p>Half dazed with the strange occurrences of the day,
Leonard Yorke rode like a madman back to Yorke
Towers to procure assistance and bring poor Will Venners
to its hospitable shelter. Galloping up the avenue
which led to the house, Leonard threw his bridle to the
servant who met him there, and springing from the
horse, ordered that the low phaeton be brought around
at once to convey Captain Venners to York Towers, with
a hurried explanation of the finding of the poor fellow,
badly hurt, in the swamp a half mile away.</p>

<p>While the man hastened away to obey his commands,
Leonard ran into the house. He was met in the hall by
Hilda. Her face wore a look of triumph; her glorious
dark eyes sparkled; she was wondrously beautiful—the
subtle, seductive beauty of a sleek tigress of the jungle,
with its shining eyes and satiny skin; its cruel claws hidden
by the velvety skin, but <i>there</i>, all the same, and ready
for use at the least provocation.</p>

<p>Hilda was perfectly happy, for she saw that Leonard
was returning <i>alone</i>. Violet had not been found, therefore
Leonard must still believe her false. False she <i>must</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
be, or she would never have gone away from Yorke
Towers as she had done.</p>

<p>But, all the same, Hilda <i>knew</i> that Violet had not
eloped with Will Venners. She laid one white hand
lightly upon Leonard’s arm, and lifted her lovely dark
eyes to his pale, anxious face.</p>

<p>“Dear Leonard,” she began in a soft, sweet, purring
voice, the little hand grasping his coat-sleeve tighter, “I
am so sorry—<i>so</i> sorry! She is my cousin, and I am
deeply attached to her; but I can not close my eyes to
her glaring faults, her many imperfections. And now
this fearful disgrace! Poor, misguided Violet! she has
gone away with handsome Will Venners, and we shall
never see her again.”</p>

<p>With an impatient movement which he could not repress,
Leonard released the clinging hand. He was thoroughly
aroused, and had no patience with Hilda’s nonsense
now.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, Miss Rutledge,” he said, sternly.
“Violet may have faults—we are all of us only human,
and liable to err—but if she has, I have never perceived
them. To me she is blameless—and she has <i>not</i> eloped
with Will Venners or any other man. She has been abducted;
and Will Venners lies down in the swamp below
Yorke Towers, badly wounded—perhaps dying.”</p>

<p>A low cry fell upon the silence, and turning swiftly,
Leonard saw coming down the stairs, just at his side,
Jessie Glyndon, pale as death, and looking as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
she had received her death-blow. Her eyes were dark as
night, and dilated wildly, her hands were tightly clasped
together, and she was trembling like an aspen.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mr. Yorke!” she cried, wildly; “it can not
be true! He is not dying—not dying, surely! Let me go
to him—let me go! Perhaps I can do something to relieve
him. Oh, do not refuse me!”</p>

<p>Leonard turned coldly away from Hilda, and took Miss
Glyndon’s hand.</p>

<p>“Be brave,” he said in a gentle, reassuring tone. “I
am about to have him brought here. You will nurse
him, Jessie? He has told me all,” he added in a low
tone, which brought the red blood to Jessie’s pale cheeks.</p>

<p>“Will I?” she cried. “Indeed—indeed I will, Mr.
Yorke! I will do anything in my power for Captain
Venners.”</p>

<p>“Order the red room prepared for him,” said Leonard.
“I will have him here in half an hour;” and as he turned
away to enter the phaeton, which was now ready, he said
to himself: “Please Heaven, all their troubles are at an
end now.”</p>

<p>But Hilda Rutledge had no intention of allowing Leonard
to escape so easily. She darted down the steps, and
as he was about to enter the phaeton she detained him
once more.</p>

<p>“Leonard,” she whispered, softly, “tell me that you
forgive me for my rash judgment of Violet! I meant no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
wrong, only—I have seen more of her than you have,
you know.”</p>

<p>His eyes rested coldly upon her beautiful face.</p>

<p>“I forgive you, of course,” he returned; “but I warn
you, in the future, if you wish to retain my respect, to
be more charitable in your judgment of as pure a woman
as ever lived!”</p>

<p>He stepped into the phaeton, and it drove rapidly away.
He had taken one of the servants with him, while another
followed on horseback, that they might be enabled to
lift the wounded man into the phaeton without difficulty.</p>

<p>In a brief time they had reached the spot where Will
Venners lay. He was quite unconscious now, and Leonard
felt his heart sink, as they lifted the tall, soldierly
figure into the phaeton and arranged him as comfortable
as possible.</p>

<p>The drive would be of only a few moments’ duration,
and a physician had already been summoned. They
reached Yorke Towers at last, and the short drive, which
had seemed endless to Leonard, was accomplished.</p>

<p>The still unconscious man was borne into the house to
a sleeping-room upon the first floor. The physician took
possession of him, and a long examination followed.</p>

<p>After a time Leonard came to where Jessie Glyndon
was standing beside a window, gazing forth with sad
gray eyes which saw nothing of the fair scene without.</p>

<p>“Jessie,” he said in a low tone—it was quite wonderful
what good friends these two had suddenly become—“the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
doctor says that he is more seriously injured than
we thought. Only the best of care and nursing will save
him, if he can be saved at all.”</p>

<p>“He shall have that, Mr. Yorke, if you will permit me
to act as his nurse,” she said in a trembling voice. “I
can get the housekeeper to assist me; and I am willing to
lay my life down in his service!”</p>

<p>Leonard pressed her hand.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said, softly; “and I pray God that
you and he will be united yet.”</p>

<p>But there seemed little prospect of his recovery, or any
explanation being adjusted between the two lovers suffering
through a strange misunderstanding.</p>

<p>For Will Venners was delirious now, his dark eyes full
of a wild, unnatural light as they rested upon the pale,
sorrow-stricken face of the woman who loved him so, yet
whom he did not recognize, as he raved on in a vacant,
meaningless fashion, which filled the hearts of his listeners
with consternation and nearly drove Jessie distracted.</p>

<p>That night a strange occurrence took place. Chancing
to pass his mother’s door at a late hour, Leonard saw
something which nearly drove the life-blood from his
heart and deprived him of his senses.</p>

<p>The door of his mother’s chamber stood partly open,
and Mrs. Yorke lay quietly resting, but over her stooped
old Betty Harwood, and as Leonard involuntarily hesitated
he saw her drop some drops from a small vial in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
her hand, swiftly and deftly, as though accustomed to
the task, between Mrs. Yorke’s pale lips.</p>

<p>The invalid stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>“No, no, Betty!” she moaned. “Take it away. It
makes me feel faint. It is killing me!”</p>

<p>With a stifled cry, Betty Harwood’s claw-like fingers
closed upon the sick woman’s throat. But Leonard
darted into the room, and caught the would-be murderess
in a vise-like grip.</p>

</div>

<div class="chaptitle">AT LAST.</div>


<p>Dunbar led Violet out of the room and the house, out
through the tall iron gate, which closed with a loud
clang behind them, and into the waiting carriage which
stood there.</p>

<p>Violet had no hat, but the thoughtful detective had provided
a cloak which he had left in the carriage, and this
he now proceeded to wrap around the trembling form of
the girl, drawing the hood over her head.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” was all he said as he adjusted the garment
about her slight form. “I fear that you will be
cold; for even at this season the night air is chilly.”</p>

<p>Violet felt a thrill of gratitude for the man’s kindness.</p>

<p>“You are very good, Mr. Dunbar,” she returned, gratefully.
“I can never thank you enough for all your kindness
to me. What, in Heaven’s name, would have become
of me but for you? But—where are you taking me?”
she added, after a slight pause.</p>

<p>“To my own house,” he returned. “Ah! you did not
know that I am a staid married man, with the best of
wives and the sweetest of baby girls? Yes, I am a sober,
settled Benedict, Miss Arleigh, and my wife will be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
than pleased to receive you. Besides—you are going to
meet Doctor Danton there.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad,” murmured Violet, faintly, her
head drooping among the cushions of the carriage.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the poor girl was beginning to feel the
effects of her long fast; for she had not eaten anything
since dinner at Yorke Towers, the evening before.</p>

<p>Dunbar understood the case at once.</p>

<p>“Try and keep up, Miss Arleigh,” he said, encouragingly.
“We will soon be at my house, and there you
will get refreshment. See! this is the street, and there is
the house at last.”</p>

<p>For the carriage had stopped before a neat white cottage
in whose windows a bright light burned cheerfully.</p>

<p>Dunbar alighted from the carriage and took Violet in
his arms.</p>

<p>“Come, Miss Arleigh,” he said; “my wife will take
care of you now.”</p>

<p>He carried the half-fainting girl into the house and
deposited her upon a sofa in the cheery little parlor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunbar—a bright-faced, gentle-looking lady—came
to Violet’s side and removed the cloak.</p>

<p>“Why, she is fainting!” cried the lady in a tone of
alarm.</p>

<p>“And so would you, too, my dear,” observed her husband,
bluntly, “if you had not eaten or drunk a mouthful
for over twenty-four hours, besides being subjected to
an intense strain of excitement and terror—actually in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
peril of your life. Ask no questions now, Bertha, but
get some wine and crackers—something very light. She
must be brought around by degrees.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunbar flew to obey his directions, and soon returned
with wine and a little light refreshment.</p>

<p>After a time Violet revived and was able to sit up.
She grew rapidly better, and when Mrs. Dunbar had assisted
her to retire, and sat down at the bedside, watching
the white lids flutter down over the beautiful dark eyes,
Violet felt that her great peril was over, and she was safe
in a very heaven of comfort and rest. A good night’s
sleep restored her entirely, and when morning came and
Mrs. Dunbar entered her room bearing a tempting breakfast
in her own hands for her young charge, Violet could
not repress her tears of gratitude for this kind care.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Dunbar,” she said, starting up, “you are
making too much of me. Let me wait upon myself.”</p>

<p>The lady smiled as she placed the waiter upon a table
near.</p>

<p>“No; I prefer to take care of you myself,” she said.
“Mr. Dunbar says that you must be very careful, and try
to be as strong as possible. You will have to go with him
this morning to the prison, for the charge against Warrington
must be substantiated; also you must identify old
Langley as the physician in charge of that horrible institution.
The morning papers are full of his arrest and
the <i>exposé</i> of the asylum. Just think of it! people who
lived right there in the very neighborhood did not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
the real character of the place! Eat your breakfast, my
dear; but first let me help you bathe your face and hands.
I will have the bath prepared for you later; then you will
feel better.”</p>

<p>An hour afterward, feeling herself refreshed, Violet entered
the cozy parlor, where Mrs. Dunbar with her golden-haired
fairy of a child awaited her. A moment
more and Mr. Dunbar appeared, accompanied by Doctor
Danton.</p>

<p>At sight of his familiar face, Violet started to her feet.
Jack Danton went swiftly forward and took the slender
form in his arms, kissing her pale cheek.</p>

<p>“My child”—his voice was low and trembling—“thank
God and Dunbar that you are safe! Now listen
to me. With Mrs. Dunbar’s assistance I have procured
you a change of clothing, so that you can make a respectable
appearance in the street. Not a very gallant
speech to make to a fair lady,” he added, his eyes twinkling
with merriment; “but you are really quite dilapidated
as you are. And you must go with me to the
prison upon business connected with that villain Warrington,
after which I have a little business for you to
attend to.”</p>

<p>Violet obeyed in dazed silence. So many strange events
had come into her life that the girl felt as though she had
lost her own identity. In bewildered silence she went
back to her room, where she found a neat street-dress
of gray, with hat, gloves, and veil to match. Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
fitted her quite creditably, and she soon returned to the
parlor looking more like her own sweet self than when
she had last entered it.</p>

<p>Doctor Danton smiled in a fatherly way as his eyes
rested upon the sweet, pale face.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, are you ready? Then we will drive
at once to the prison, and get this unpleasant business
over with. Come, Dunbar!”</p>

<p>Violet was soon in the carriage which waited outside,
and, accompanied by the two gentlemen, was driven rapidly
to the parish prison.</p>

<p>To the day of her death Violet never forgot that morning
and the scene which followed.</p>

<p>Gilbert Warrington’s scowling face, the ugly countenance
of the oily old hypocrite Langley, and Mrs. Carter’s
cringing ways as she pleaded with Violet to help her out
of the trouble. But Violet’s heart was adamant to all
appeals from such as she. She went bravely through
what was required of her, and all was soon over. The
result of the examination was that Gilbert Warrington
was remanded to prison without the benefit of bail, while
Langley and Mrs. Carter eventually went to the State
penitentiary. The various charges against Warrington
would consume time in their trial before justice could
be done. As they were leaving the court-room, Violet
caught his cruel eyes fixed upon her with a threatening
expression and such bitter hatred, that the blood ran
cold within her veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“He will find some way to be revenged!” she murmured,
faintly, trembling with apprehension. “I can see
it in his eyes. He means to be even with me yet, and
somehow—although he is safe in prison—I can not
help dreading him, and fearing that he may succeed in
his designs. Heaven help me if I ever fall into his hands
again!”</p>

<p>She re-entered the carriage, still with Doctor Danton
and Mr. Dunbar, and they were driven rapidly uptown.
Violet asked no questions as to their designation. She
knew that she was safe with these two good friends.
The drive was a very long one; the carriage turned down
Henry Clay Avenue at last, and then for the first time
Violet expressed surprise at the very lengthy drive. Doctor
Danton took her hand in his.</p>

<p>“My dear,” he said, kindly, “trust to me; I am taking
you to a person whom I wish you to identify. We are
going to—to—the Louisiana Retreat.”</p>

<p>Violet had heard of this asylum, but she had never
visited it. She felt a strange feeling of terror steal over
her heart. Did they consider her insane, or that her brain
was in any way affected, after all? But she restrained
her emotions and kept quiet, feeling that soon all would
be explained. The carriage halted before the retreat at
last. She alighted and followed the two men into the
building.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Doctor Danton, “do not be afraid. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
wish you to look at this lady and tell me if you have ever
seen her before. This is very important.”</p>

<p>Violet followed him, with a strange feeling of awe
creeping over her, into a small, neatly furnished room,
where upon a bed a female form lay quietly sleeping.
The room was in semi-darkness; but as they entered, the
physician threw open the blinds and let a stream of sunlight
into the room.</p>

<p>“Come here, Violet,” he said, gently.</p>

<p>She approached the bedside and stood with eyes riveted
upon the face which lay upon the pillow, her heart
overflowing with a wild delight which nearly suffocated
her. For there before her—could it be true?—in an apparently
sound slumber, her thin, white hands folded
upon her breast, her beautiful face, like the face of a
marble statue, lay her own dear mother—Rosamond
Arleigh.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
</div>

<div class="chaptitle">VIOLET HEARS THE STORY.</div>


<p>For a time Violet stood like one bereft of her senses.
Her brain was in a whirl, her heart throbbed painfully;
she was overcome by emotion, and the strange, wild joy
of this meeting, which was more than she had dared hope
for.</p>

<p>Rosamond Arleigh lay there before her, pale as death
and greatly emaciated; but it was her mother, all the
same. Starting at last from that rapt trance of delight,
Violet stooped as though to take the wasted form in
her hands.</p>

<p>“Mamma!” she cried, joyfully. But Doctor Danton
laid his hand upon her shoulder and drew her gently
away.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, my dear,” he said, softly; but his kind
voice was trembling in spite of himself. “Do not
awaken or disturb her. If you do, she—she may die.”</p>

<p>With trembling horror Violet fell back, and then Doctor
Danton led her from the room. He seemed perfectly
at home in the premises. No one came near him
to inquire his business there; he seemed to have a right
to take possession.</p>

<p>“You see, my child,” he began, as Violet sunk into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
seat and leaned her head against its cushioned back, worn
and weary, “I have quite a long story to tell you. But
first you must have a glass of wine, and something to
strengthen you.”</p>

<p>He soon procured the necessary refreshment, and after
Violet had eaten and had drunk a glass of wine, she felt
stronger and better.</p>

<p>“Now, tell me,” she urged, persuasively.</p>

<p>Doctor Danton smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, you have to thank our astute friend, Dunbar,
over there, for all that has been done. He swore that
he would never give up the search until Mrs. Arleigh was
found, or proof positive that she was really dead—drowned
in the little river on the road to Belleville. For
Dunbar had never put much faith in the belief that she
had met her death there, although he had found her
slipper and cloak upon the very brink of the stream.</p>

<p>“Such evidence, purely circumstantial, is not always
reliable. So said our wise and learned Dunbar, and
Dunbar, as usual, was right. But he gave up the case apparently,
and the few who interested themselves in the
attempt to prove that Rosamond Arleigh was not dead—oh,
they are very few, I assure you, Violet; for the world
at large believes her lying in the grave-yard near The
Oaks!—they looked upon Dunbar’s theories as absurd.
But all that did not daunt our detective.</p>

<p>“Swiftly and silently he went on with his hunt. He
spent days traveling up and down the river, and at last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
one day, near its mouth, he chanced upon a schooner,
whose captain told him a wild tale in regard to the body
of a woman which had been brought on board his vessel
by a negro named Clark some weeks previous. The captain
declared that the body had been found by Clark at
the very spot where Mrs. Arleigh’s cloak and slipper had
been picked up by Dunbar.</p>

<p>“The detective put two and two together; then got on
board the schooner and went to New Orleans.</p>

<p>“Once there, he went to the Charity Hospital, whither,
the captain declared, the woman had been taken when
signs of life had been discovered.</p>

<p>“At the hospital Dunbar made the acquaintance of two
physicians, who remembered the case, and showed him
the entry in the books which recorded the arrival of the
unknown woman, describing her appearance and dress,
and stating that she was suffering from certain wounds
about her head which had produced fracture of the skull.</p>

<p>“The two physicians had performed an operation for
the purpose of lifting the portion of the skull pressing
upon the brain. That operation had failed. The consequence
was that the woman would be insane—be brave,
Violet; try, try, my child!—for the balance of her days.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Doctor Danton, I can not—can not bear it!”
sobbed the girl. “Perhaps it would be better if she were
indeed at rest!”</p>

<p>“Not so, my child. Listen. The physicians stated
that a second operation might be performed in time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
when the patient would be a little stronger and better
able to endure it.</p>

<p>“The second attempt might be successful; the case was
not utterly hopeless, they declared. But, in the meantime,
the patient must be removed from the hospital—that
grand refuge for the suffering, which is a boon
and blessing to the people of New Orleans—ay, to the
whole state of Louisiana.</p>

<p>“Although supported by the munificence of a chartered
institution which is bitterly opposed by the cranks
and ultra-‘moral’ people of the state, it is the only reliance
upon which Louisiana can lean for means to defray
its expenses. I am no politician, my child, but, as a
<i>physician</i>, I would feel very sorry to see the New
Orleans Charity Hospital closed for lack of means with
which to support it. But let me hasten my story.</p>

<p>“Your mother was discharged from the hospital, and
because of her condition was sent to the retreat. This
institution is a good one, and here she has remained ever
since, very well cared for.</p>

<p>“And to this place the wise Dunbar tracked her down,
saw and identified her, then telegraphed for me at once.
Of course, I did not let the grass grow under my feet,
but came to New Orleans on the first train after receiving
Dunbar’s message. I came straight to the retreat;
fortunately I am so well known here that no one in control
interfered with my actions. The case was placed in
my hands. I have worked over it faithfully, and now—now—Violet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
comes the most important part. Yesterday
I performed the second operation, assisted by one of
the physicians from the Charity Hospital of which I have
spoken—a clever fellow he is, too. The result of that
operation will be made known to us when—Rosamond
Arleigh awakes. She has been sleeping ever since the
operation was performed. I thought best to tell you the
whole story now, my child, and place the matter before
you in its true light. When she opens her eyes again,
she will either be as well as ever, or—she will be insane
for the rest of her life.”</p>

<p>Violet uttered a groan of despair.</p>

<p>“Try and be brave, my child,” he whispered. “Violet—Violet,
you are like my own child to me, for, oh! my
dear, I love her, I have loved your mother for years, and
if she recovers I shall ask her to become my wife. If she
never recovers, I will devote the rest of my life to her
care and protection.”</p>

<p>Violet lifted the doctor’s hand to her lips.</p>

<p>“God bless you, Doctor Danton!” she said, softly;
“you are a true friend. How can I be helpless and alone
with two such friends as you and Mr. Dunbar?”</p>

<p>“And Leonard Yorke!” interposed the doctor, shyly.</p>

<p>Violet’s sweet face flushed.</p>

<p>“Leonard is very jealous and unreasonable at times,”
she said; “but one can not turn from a person because
of his faults. We all have our faults, and I <i>do</i> love him,
Doctor Danton, I do, indeed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>The doctor smiled serenely.</p>

<p>“And quite right in you, my dear. I believe that he is
worthy of you, with the exception of that cranky jealousy
of his. But that in time may evaporate, especially
if you do not give him just cause to indulge in it.”</p>

<p>“I never will. But tell me, doctor, do you think she
will sleep much longer? And when she awakes——”</p>

<p>The doctor rose abruptly, drawing his hand across his
eyes as though to clear away a mist.</p>

<p>“We must leave that to God, my child,” he said, solemnly.
“All that human skill can do has been done. We
can only hope and pray. But if the worst comes, you
must not forget that there is a Comforter, a Refuge
for us in our sorrow. But, oh, my God! it will be a bitter,
heart-breaking grief to me!”</p>

<p>He broke down completely and sobbed like a child. All
at once he started up.</p>

<p>“Violet, forgive me!” he cried. “But I love her so
dearly, and I have controlled my feelings for so long!
Listen! I thought I heard a sound in her room.”</p>

<p>He crept softly to the door of the room where that
poor wreck lay alone, and stooping, applied his ear to the
key-hole, while he listened attentively.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he whispered, after a moment’s silence; “I
really believe that the crisis is come, and that she is
awaking. Now, Violet, my child, a great deal depends
upon you and your power of self-control. Go into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
room as though nothing had happened, as though you
were both at home at The Oaks, and—see how she is.”</p>

<p>It was an awful ordeal, but the girl nerved herself to
endure it. Pale as marble, and shaking with nervous
excitement which she bravely conquered at length, Violet
opened the door and entered the room.</p>

<p>A pause of silence ensued, during which Doctor Danton
and Dunbar, in the other room, could hear the throbbing
of their own hearts—a long, awful silence, yet in truth,
it did not last three seconds; then—then there was a slight
movement as the sick woman raised herself slowly from
the pillows; then a wild exclamation, “<i>Violet, my child!</i>”
a stifled cry of “Mamma! oh, mamma!” and the two listeners
knew that all was well.</p>

<div class="chaptitle">SOME LESSONS LEARNED.</div>


<p>When Leonard Yorke seized the old woman in his
strong grasp she flashed about, uttering a mad cry of rage
and despair. One glance into the young man’s white,
stern face and flashing eyes, and the wretch realized that
she was at last unmasked, and her hideous purpose laid
bare to the censorious gaze of the young man whose only
parent she had been about to murder.</p>

<p>“You murderess!” panted Leonard, wildly, his grasp
tightening upon the woman’s shoulder, “you miserable
murderess! I know all at last! It is your work, all this!
You are to blame that my mother lies here slowly dying!
By the Heaven above me, I have a mind to choke the life
from your body!”</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes fell guiltily from before his wrathful,
burning gaze. With a groan of horror she sunk
upon her knees at his feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Leonard! Mr. Leonard!” she whined. “I’ve
been here so long, and I’ve worked so faithfully——”</p>

<p>“Hush, you murderess!” he interrupted, sternly.
“Nothing that you can say will save you from your
just punishment. First, you shall confess your object.
Why did you seek to take my mother’s life?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>Old Betty began to sob.</p>

<p>“Well, sir. I’ll confess the truth,” she moaned.
“Mrs. Yorke knows where the papers are hid away in the
east chamber; somewhere there, but no one can find them.
I only wanted to frighten her into telling me; for those
papers—well, sir—<i>you</i> would give a heap of money for
them, to say nothing of what Miss Arleigh would give.”</p>

<p>Grimly and silently Leonard drew his handkerchief
from his pocket, and without a word proceeded to tie the
woman’s hands together. In the struggle which ensued
her hair was disarranged, and to his astonishment he
found that she wore a wig, and that the seemingly old
woman was not old at all. He fell back in utter amazement.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded. But Betty made no
reply. Having fastened her hands securely, he pushed
her into a small closet, and closed and locked its door
upon her. There was an open transom over the door, so
she need not suffer for want of air. Then, trembling with
apprehension, he hastened to his mother’s bedside. She
gazed into his face with a troubled look.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, my son,” she whispered; “for that
woman has been the terror of my life for the past few
days. But I dared make no complaint, for I found that I
was in her power. Leonard, sit down by my side; I
have something to say—a confession to make. Yes, I
must tell you all now; and I believe that when it is off my
mind, I shall get well. It concerns poor Rosamond Arleigh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
I was so jealous of her, for I loved Harold
Arleigh dearly; he was the first and best love of my life.
But he did not return my affection; his whole heart and
soul belonged to Rosamond. In my jealous rage after
their marriage, I formed a horrible plot, which a strange
combination of circumstances helped me to carry out.
The church in which Harold and Rosamond were privately
married was burned to the ground, and the marriage
record consumed. The old clergyman died of fright
after the horrors of the conflagration; the two witnesses
of the marriage were both lost at sea soon after. The
strange complication of events went to form a tragedy. <i>I
stole their marriage certificate</i>—may God forgive me!—and
hid it away in the east chamber here, at York Towers.
There was no way of proving the marriage, and the shock
of the calamity broke Harold Arleigh’s heart. He was
very weak and frail in constitution, and it killed him.
Violet was half grown then, and the horrible fact that her
legitimacy could not be proven to the world—killed her
father. It might have killed her mother also, only we
women will keep alive in emergencies where a man succumbs,
simply for the sake of our children. Leonard, you
know my guilty secret at last. In the east chamber, where
old Betty, I am certain, has often vainly sought it, you
will find full proof of Violet’s legitimacy. Look in the
right-hand corner of the wall as you enter the room.
Some five feet from the floor you will find a <i>figure six</i>.
Press upon it; it will open and reveal a secret receptacle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
which contains the certificate of Harold Arleigh’s marriage
to Rosamond, also some other papers as proof.
Can you ever forgive me, Leonard? I know that you and
Violet love each other, and she is worthy to be your wife.”</p>

<p>What could he do but forgive her? After that Mrs.
Yorke grew rapidly better, and was ere long able to take
her place once more with the family.</p>

<p>Will Venners improved rapidly under Jessie’s tender
care, and when he was able to sit up, a clergyman called
one evening, and in a few impressive words made Will
and Jessie husband and wife.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a letter from Doctor Danton had
broken the news of Violet’s safety, and stated that they
would arrive at Yorke Towers in time for the wedding.
Imagine the astonishment and delight with which Rosamond
Arleigh was welcomed as one arisen from the
dead, alive, and in her right mind. Mutual explanations
followed, and in the midst of it all Leonard produced the
missing marriage certificate. But out of pity for his penitent
mother, he merely explained that he had found it in
the east chamber. But even before he had sought the
hidden document, he had begged Violet humbly to forgive
his foolish jealousy, and be his wife as soon as possible.
And Violet’s reply had been all that he could desire.</p>

<p>That very day Leonard chanced to find in a pocket of a
cast-off coat Will Venners’ unfortunate poem, which had
so wofully miscarried. Leonard brought it straight to
that gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Will,” he began, trying hard to keep back the
little green-eyed monster which threatened to arise within
his heart, “be good enough to explain to me why you
wrote such a poem to Violet, yet loving Jessie Glyndon
all the time?”</p>

<p>Will laughed aloud. He began to see the truth at last.</p>

<p>“This poem was not intended for Miss Arleigh,” he
said; “I wrote it for Jessie, and begged Miss Arleigh to
deliver it to her the night of Miss Arleigh’s birthday
ball. I had been a flirt—an unmitigated flirt—for so long
that I shrunk from anything that might look like trifling
with Jessie, as she was so proud and reserved, and yet I
<i>did</i> want her to believe the sentiments of that poem, and I
made a fool of myself, as usual,” he broke off merrily.
“Leonard, old boy, I’ve learned a lesson, though, of
course, I shall never need it now. It is this: Never court
a woman by proxy. If you love her, tell her so; do not
trust your confession to paper. Nine times out of ten it
will cause trouble.”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> have been a jealous brute!” cried Leonard, frankly;
“<i>my</i> lesson shall last me as long as I live. Violet shall
have no cause hereafter to dread my jealous wrath.”</p>

<p>And he kept his word.</p>

<p>Leonard and Violet were quietly married, and live at
Yorke Towers with Mrs. Yorke, quite sweet and amiable
now.</p>

<p>Jack Danton and Rosamond Arleigh are husband and
wife, and live at The Oaks, where Dunbar and his good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
wife and golden-haired child are always welcome. Captain
Venners and his wife reside in New Orleans, where
Will has a good Government position, and talks no more
of going to Texas to do the cow-boy act.</p>

<p>Hilda Rutledge married a rich old man, a merchant
in the Crescent City, and, with her mother, leads fashionable
society, and makes her elderly husband frantic
with her numberless flirtations.</p>

<p>And Gilbert Warrington? He was sentenced to a long
term in the state penitentiary, but at the last moment
some one succeeded in smuggling poison into his cell, and
in the morning when the officers entered to lead him
forth for his journey to the penitentiary, he was dead and
cold. The poison had been conveyed to him by Betty
Harwood, whom Leonard, in the softness of his heart,
had allowed to go free. She proved to be Gilbert Warrington’s
<i>wife</i>, and for his sake she had sinned. She
still lives in New Orleans, a wicked, soured old woman.</p>

<p>This is a true tale, made up of the incidents which
really occurred. And if there is a lesson to be learned
by its perusal, it is this: If a man loves a woman, he
should tell her so plainly and frankly. Also, to beware of
<i>jealousy</i>, that fiend which can turn heaven into hell, and
which is “strong as death and as cruel as the grave!”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
